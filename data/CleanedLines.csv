887,1,one second 'cause that sounds really good is jackass one word or two one right 'cause 'cause of the show it's one,Jim
888,1,one word,Dwight
889,1,i've really learned from the greats the great improvisers drew carey ryan stiles uh the brady guy not so much he's more the signing wayne brady um robin williams oh man would i love to go head-to-head with him oh that would be exciting 'hi i'm mork from ork' well i'm bork from spork nanoo nanoo jibelee baloobaloo 'that's good morning vietnam' well hello to you you know it would be god and you know what sometimes when i'm watching somebody like um like jay leno he'll be half way through his step and i will already be laughing at the punch line he hasn't even gotten to it he doesn't even know what it is it so it's fun you know it's fun having a mind that works like that that is just a few steps ahead of comedically ahead of like what's going on like i'll watch tv and i'll be watching a show and i will think oh i know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny and then they do or um i know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down there's going to be some sort of insult and there is you know there's like 'oh you're god your butt is fat' and i knew it i know it's like i knew they were going to say that i knew they were gonna go there don't go there um but other you know it's like uh you know leno um and letterman carson you know need i say more no,Michael
890,1,oh um jan wants you to call her,Dwight
891,1,we're all going bowling,Michael
892,1,michael,Dwight
893,1,oh god dwight come on,Michael
894,1,i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing,Dwight
895,1,there's no downsizing,Michael
896,1,i but if there were i'd be protected as assistant regional manager,Dwight
897,1,assistant to the regional manager dwight,Michael
898,1,yeah so i don't have to worry,Dwight
899,1,look look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing okay,Michael
900,1,but there's no downsizing so just don't,Michael
901,1,bottom line do i need to be worried,Dwight
902,1,mmm mm mm maybe,Michael
903,1,it looks like there's gonna be downsizing and it's part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words 'you're fired' 'you're foir-ed uh you're foir-ed' it just makes people sad and an office can't function that way no way 'you're foir-ed' i think if i had a catchphrase it would be 'you're hired and you can work here as long as you want' but that's unrealistic so,Michael
904,1,it's a real shame 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work,Dwight
906,1,i didn't do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear what's the scuttlebutt,Dwight
907,1,get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it not bad not bad at all all right and the birthday person is drum roll please here we go who is the birthday birthday person,Michael
908,1,who is it who's the birthday,Michael
909,1,um actually we don't have any staff birthdays coming up,Pam

918,1,yeah why not sure go ahead live a little come on pam come on shake it up shake it up shake it up,Michael
919,1,brrrp uh spock are there any signs of life down there well let me check captain eeee eeee eeee eeee no captain no signs of life down here just a wet blanket named pam brr-rrrp star trek,Michael
921,1,what,Angela
923,1,no yeah i think that's a good idea,Angela
925,1,what color do you guys think,Angela
927,1,how about green,Pam
928,1,i think green is kind of whoreish,Angela
929,1,this was tough i suggested we flip a coin but angela said she doesn't like to gamble of course by saying that she was gambling that i wouldn't smack her,Pam
930,1,these are my party-planning beeyatches pulled off an amazing '80s party last year off the hook,Michael
931,1,so i was thinking if you haven't already got a cake um maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from baskin-robbins those are very good very delicious,Michael
932,1,meredith's allergic to dairy so,Angela
933,1,she's not the only one that's going to be eating it right i think everybody likes ice-cream cake it's not uh it's not just about her so,Michael
934,1,it is her birthday,Pam
935,1,mint chocolate chip that'd be good how about some mint chocolate chip,Michael
936,1,hey so listen i was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and i formed an alliance 'cause of the downsizing i think an alliance might be a good idea you know help each other out,Dwight
937,1,do you want to form an alliance with me,Dwight
938,1,absolutely i do,Jim
939,1,good good excellent ok now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected,Dwight
940,1,at that moment i was so happy i mean everything dwight does annoys me,Jim
941,1,did you get your tickets,Dwight
942,1,to what,Jim
943,1,the gun show,Dwight
944,1,and i spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him but only in ways that could get me arrested and then here he comes and he says 'no jim here's a way',Jim
945,1,there's one other thing and this is important let's keep this alliance totally a secret don't tell anyone,Dwight
946,1,an alliance,Pam

951,1,jim hey hi pam listen could i talk to you a second about the paper products,Dwight

963,1,they seem awfully chummy don't you think,Dwight
964,1,yeah what do you think that's about,Jim

2253,2,tmi too much information i used to say 'don't go there' but that is so lame now or 'you go girl' or um when did 'where's the beef' that was like a long long time ago it's funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like 'too much information' probably came on the scene i mean i didn't hear it till like this month so it's pretty recently um but you know they're generally good for like no more than five or six years,Michael
2256,2,yes i'm the designated driver which is very important we need everyone to get home safely but no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over it's expensive,Angela

2262,2,he's fat the fat accountant award,Michael
2263,2,well you seem to have this under control,Jim
2264,2,the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational i mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year which is probably why this branch will be downsized,Jim
2265,2,i am the fat accountant,Michael
2266,2,michael i need to talk to you,Dwight
2267,2,here he is,Michael
2268,2,i just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall,Dwight

2270,2,good one,Jim
2271,2,uh no no no i think something bad maybe,Dwight

2287,2,kevin,Michael

2289,2,angela it's simple just tell me what the bathroom wall says,Dwight
2290,2,i don't talk about what goes on in the restroom,Angela
2291,2,i'm not asking what you do in there i just want to know what's written about michael,Dwight

2578,2,so you are the lawyer mr o'malley i know a lot of lawyer jokes,Michael
2580,2,well it's probably because you don't get 'em,Michael
2581,2,when i said before that i was king of forwards you got to understand that i don't come up with this stuff i just forward it along you wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another,Michael

2678,2,times have changed a little and even though we're still a family here at dunder-mifflin families grow and at some point the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore i am upper management and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with pam as much as i might want to,Michael
2679,2,he said what,Pam

2708,2,toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more so that's kind of embarrassing not that i'd mind but it would never happen to me because i would make the marriage work people seem to like him because they think he's one of us but he's not he's this weird loner who just tells people 'don't do this don't do that hire this person for this reason' i would complain about him but who would i go to to complain about toby toby bias and what does he do about that nothing because he's toby what kind of name is that it's almost a girl's name i think i've known more girls named toby than guys he just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit toby is the devil toby's the devil,Michael

4645,2,you told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when jan was here,Pam
4646,2,i did not not not use those words,Michael
4648,2,no it's in like ten minutes,Michael
4649,2,everyone's waiting in the conference room,Pam
4651,2,why are we here because i value your opinions now i know a lot of don't think that i read your suggestions but i do i just sift through them every week and i really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing um so let's uh just read some of these suckers alright number one: 'what should we do to prepare for y2k',Michael
4652,2,what should we do to prepare for y2k,Dwight
4654,2,well obviously this one got stuck in the box that happens occasionally,Michael
4655,2,it happens occasionally,Dwight
4656,2,and um one down next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression' ok alright enough with the jokes nobody in here is suffering from depression,Michael
4658,2,oh ok well yeah who wrote it,Michael
4659,2,tom,Dwight
4660,2,tom then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named tom,Michael
4662,2,oh that guy that guy was weird alright next suggestion,Michael
4663,2,next suggestion,Dwight
4664,2,arrr dooby dooby do 'you need to do something about your bo',Michael
4665,2,you need to do something about your bo,Dwight
4666,2,ok i don't know who this suggestion is meant for but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody,Michael
4668,2,well toby if by me you are inferring that i have bo then i would say that is a very poor choice of words,Michael
4670,2,was i creed ok well you know what i am implying is that when we're on an elevator together i should maybe take the stairs because talk about stank not that i would ever say something like that in public and i never have and i never will i just think it's something that we should all be aware of ok now that we've learned this let's continue see this is good we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out 'you need to do something about your coffee breath'-,Michael
4671,2,you need-,Dwight
4672,2,ok,Michael
4673,2,to do something about-,Dwight
4674,2,shut up shut up shut up dwight ok i don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box,Michael

4676,2,yeah is that hard for you alright well-,Michael
4677,2,well when you have coffee breath-,Angela
4678,2,i'll work on that-,Michael
4679,2,it's hard,Angela
4680,2,let's keep going keep it going yep what do we have here we have somebody's piece of gum somebody put a piece of gum in there this is not a a garbage can this is the future of our company this is not a place for gum i don't wanna have to read these tomorrow,Michael
4681,2,yeah who wants to come in on a saturday,Dwight

4685,2,don't sleep with your boss' do you think this is referring to you boning jan,Dwight
4687,2,i don't understand why you're so upset,Michael
4689,2,let me ask you-,Michael
4691,2,ok let me ask you this,Michael
4693,2,let me ask you something,Michael
4695,2,where did you get your outfit,Michael
4696,2,you are giving me this raise i deserve this raise yes yes yes hiya the least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation keeya eyah yes why are you gonna give me this raise why because i'm awesome i am awesome,Dwight
4697,2,i just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened,Michael
4699,2,look-,Michael
4700,2,michael,Dwight
4701,2,oh my god,Michael
4702,2,i'm sorry am i interrupting oh god; were you guys making out,Dwight

4707,2,ok great your performance has been adequate you may leave; goodbye,Michael
4709,2,you wanna talk now good; ok dwight leave,Michael
4710,2,uh wait i would like to discuss my raise,Dwight
4711,2,why on earth would we give you a raise,Michael
4712,2,that is an excellent question thank you for asking let me bring up one word: dedication i have never been late also i have never missed a day due to illness even when i had walking pneumonia i even come in on holidays,Dwight
4713,2,you do how do you get in,Michael
4714,2,i have a copy of your key,Dwight
4716,2,that is a serious offense very serious as is toying with a man's heart,Michael
4718,2,i'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace,Dwight
4719,2,ok third wheel why don't you do that,Michael
4720,2,for instance the time i brought in deer jerky for the whole office,Dwight
4721,2,that was deer gross oh,Michael
4722,2,you liked it,Dwight
4723,2,oh did not,Michael
4724,2,jan have you ever had deer,Dwight
4726,2,it's a delicacy and you know what it's an aphrodisiac so when we're done here you guys could go over to the antler lodge sample some deer and talk about my raise,Dwight
4727,2,what do you say jan,Michael
4729,2,ok you just uh clear your head,Michael
4732,2,and in conclusion i think that lex luthor said it best when he said 'dad you have no idea what i'm capable of',Dwight
4733,2,that's from superman,Michael
4734,2,smallville and that is why i feel that i deserve this raise,Dwight
4735,2,do you think michael and jan actually,Pam
4736,2,i don't really wanna picture it but thank you pam,Jim
4737,2,how do you come back from that,Pam

4739,2,no i mean doing that with michael how do you come back from that,Pam
4740,2,oh-,Jim
4741,2,as a human being,Pam
4742,2,yeah no i don't think you can,Jim
4744,2,wait,Michael
4746,2,wait wait wait come i just i just wanna know why,Michael
4748,2,ok so you're saying that there is a different time or place,Michael
4750,2,well ok well never as in 'never ever ever' or never as in there's still a chance,Michael
4752,2,i just want to know from the horse's mouth what is the dealio,Michael
4754,2,am i too short,Michael
4756,2,really,Michael
4758,2,i appreciate that thank you,Michael
4760,2,no i wasn't i didn't cry-,Michael
4762,2,so my looks have nothing to do with it,Michael
4764,2,jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now and it doesn't matter how great a guy i am and that is all i needed; i'm good i can go home now,Michael
4765,2,hey it's 12:20; where the hell's dwight,Michael

4771,2,today is performance-review day company-wide and i'm a little concerned about my review i exceeded my sick days and my personal days because i just couldn't take it and i don't have a good answer for him when he asks me,Oscar
4772,2,so,Michael
4773,2,michael i don't know what to say,Oscar
4774,2,um you're in accounting,Michael

4778,2,you know what this is,Dwight
4779,2,yes,Jim
4780,2,no you don't,Dwight
4781,2,then why the question,Jim
4782,2,this is a visual aid for my performance review budget is tight and if anyone is getting a raise it is gonna be a fight to the death and i intend on winning that fight 'dwight: determined worker intense good worker hard worker terrific dwight',Dwight
4783,2,i have one too jim jim is jim my name is jim,Jim
4784,2,that's a total waste of your 'm',Dwight

4877,2,yeah that gould is a real interesting guy a gem i can see why he and jan are no longer together if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship he was verbally abusive he was curt he was he had an inability to communicate shall i say he was emotionally unavailable i don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did,Michael
4878,2,never,Michael
4880,2,well then gould wasn't kidding,Michael
4882,2,nothing i just,Michael

4894,2,ex-husband you have to let it go,Michael
4897,2,what is an office is it a group of people maybe is it an idea of course yes is it a living organism exactly yes and any single cell organism has to have a spine and that's me but the spine is always controlled by a brain and that is jan but the brain needs a heart and that is me again so ironic you know what the heart is smarter than the brain but the brain is so effing hot,Michael

5413,2,i got it we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap,Michael
5414,2,what is yankee swap,Jim
5415,2,one person chooses a gift the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift if your gift gets stolen then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift,Michael

5417,2,yeah we call it white elephant,Pam
5418,2,well i call it fun,Michael
5419,2,why are we doing this,Oscar
5420,2,because it's better because it's more special,Michael
5421,2,it sounds mean,Angela
5422,2,shut it no it's not okay just give it a shot,Michael
5423,2,michael should have asked the party planning committee first he's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere,Angela
5424,2,okay meredith is up first here's the deal you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten like the oven mitt,Michael
5426,2,oh shouldn't we i bought that specifically for pam,Jim

5449,2,sucker see i wanted somebody to take it boom reverse psychology,Michael
5450,2,reverse psychology is an awesome tool i don't know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid works like a charm,Michael
5451,2,'in addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute',Michael
5452,2,you and me michael yes,Dwight
5453,2,who wants to take paintball lessons how is that better than an ipod,Michael

5472,2,what is she so upset about,Michael
5473,2,maybe because you hated her present so much,Pam
5474,2,come on i think that yankee swap was a big hit i think it's a success and i'm the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets,Michael
5475,2,yeah but michael the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people,Jim
5477,2,well i didn't i got a big bonus because i fired devon and i used the money to buy something awesome sue me,Michael

5494,2,true but i get sinus infections and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems,Dwight
5495,2,okay,JIm
5496,2,and pouring it directly into your nose like so,Dwight
5497,2,to think that my gift for pam will be used for that it's a little too much to handle,Jim

7547,2,i know it was borderline at best and and jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um i'm really sorry it will never happen again,Michael

7650,2,what if i give a really long extended thank you for instance 'thank you mr blank thank you very very very',Dwight

8453,2,that's not how i taught you right my hump my hump my lovely lady lump check it out,Michael
8454,2,michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited but he's also under a lot of pressure which builds up until he's ready to explode as his right-hand man it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself if only for a moment,Dwight
8455,2,okay here's the thing about bosses and employees a good boss will say 'hey it's my birthday celebrate me' a great boss will say 'hey it's my birthday celebrate yourselves because you are the ones who made me great and i will acknowledge your contributions with donuts',Michael

8725,2,one thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user who's an abuser because we don't know it could be anybody your instinct is to say it's somebody-like stanley or oscar,Michael
8727,2,no no your instinct that your gut reaction is to say that but i don't that's that's those are instincts that have been created by media and hype and they are wrong what i am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are it may be the person you least suspect it may be somebody hot like pam or it could be somebody matronly like phyllis but just not me,Michael

8819,2,a mediator's tool chest okay well before we get started you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style,Michael
8820,2,can we go i have a lot of work to do,Angela
8821,2,no okay this is important the first style is lose/lose,Michael
8822,2,what's the next one,Oscar
8823,2,just hold on please okay if we do lose/lose neither of you gets what you want do you understand you you would both lose now i need to ask you do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation,Michael
8824,2,can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever,Angela
8825,2,win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win the important difference here is with win/win/win we all win me too i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work,Michael
8826,2,okay since this is the disputed poster now one at a time i want you to express your feelings using 'i' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements,Michael
8827,2,i got this poster for christmas and i feel i want to see it everyday it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and god has a really cute sense of humor,Angela
8828,2,come on seriously that,Michael
8829,2,i don't like looking at it it's creepy and in bad taste and it's just offensive to me it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it it's kitsch it's the opposite of art it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno i'm talking about the,Oscar
8830,2,okay okay stop stop stop let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win,Michael
8831,2,win,Pam
8832,2,yes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt which oscar wears that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar she can see it win/win/win,Michael
8833,2,no,Oscar
8834,2,that's no,Angela
8835,2,okay well brainstorm own the solution,Michael
8836,2,how about i leave it up,Angela
8837,2,how 'bout she takes it down,Oscar
8838,2,how about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays,Pam
8839,2,okay that is called a compromise and it is style 3 and it is not ideal to sum up win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt win/lose - take the poster down compromise - tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is make the poster into a t-shirt win/win,Michael
8840,2,win,Pam
8841,2,fine,Oscar
8842,2,but it,Angela
8843,2,it is done,Michael

8867,2,nice,Pam
8868,2,you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me,Michael
8870,2,how many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee and did you get what you wanted or were you merely listened to you forget about your problem and you move on that is outrageous i love this place and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering okay today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open where it can be resolved alright how about the phyllis/angela dispute,Michael
8871,2,you already did me,Angela
8872,2,that's what she said the thing is angela you are in here an awful lot you have complained about everybody in the office except dwight which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight toby by the way what does 'redacted' mean there is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted',Michael
8874,2,oh ok there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago,Michael

8903,2,okay phyllis you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks and you tried to get off the party planning committee,Michael

8971,2,yes five bucks each and it was totally worth it,Jim
8972,2,'this morning i found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and jim halpert tried to convince me i committed murder i think he may be the real murderer' 'jim halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room when i went to save the child i saw meredith on the can' gah 'this morning i knocked myself in the head with the phone',Michael
8973,2,that actually took a while i had to put uh more and more nickels into his handset till he got used to the weight and then i just took 'em all out,Jim
8974,2,'every time i typed my name it said 'diapers'',Michael
8975,2,just a simple macro you know these actually don't sound that funny one after another but he does deserve it though,Jim
8976,2,by the end of the day my desk was about two feet closer to the copier',Michael
8977,2,yeah i just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom and that's how i spent my entire day that day,Jim
8978,2,the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage where they dig into your body very hard and it is very painful and apparently some people throw up but the next day they feel great i've never had one they sound awful,Michael
8979,2,maybe stanford would be cool,Jim

9024,2,one two didn't say three did i,Michael
9025,2,but i'm sort of an expert at photoshop so it turned out fine in the end when people work together there is going to be conflict you can't outrun your problems,Michael
9026,2,hey pam it's jim um i have a doctor's appointment in the city so i probably won't be in till the late afternoon just thought i'd let you know okay bye,Jim
9028,2,oh thanks,Jim
9029,2,and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing but here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage and that is something toby will never understand,Michael
9030,2,what is this what happened here,Dwight
9031,2,i don't know,Jim
9032,2,oh this does not look good did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning,Dwight

9034,2,a prank huh this is official police line tape okay it's not a prank,Dwight
9035,2,probably is,Jim
9036,2,damn it people someone must have seen something oh you people are useless jesus,Dwight

9038,2,oh no no don't i can't,Dwight
9039,2,just cut through it man it's no big deal,Jim
9040,2,this is why i'm a volunteer sheriff's deputy and you're not,Dwight
9041,2,that is not why wow man he really wants to get in touch with you maybe it's a murder,Jim
9042,2,no there's no blood,Dwight

9049,2,on big brother something important happens every day but real life is not like that,Michael
9051,2,he sometimes wears glasses write that down also that may not be his real hair,Dwight
9052,2,i hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry my dad was like that i would say 'what's wrong dad what's wrong dad what's wrong dad what's wrong dad what's wrong dad what's wrong dad' over and over and over and he would just look at me like i was an idiot,Michael
9053,2,i'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these id badges taken,Dwight
9055,2,let me see your id,Dwight
9056,2,there is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby and they can't decide so they bring the baby to a wise man just like a manager in those days and the wise man says 'i will adopt this baby and raise it as a hindu' see they didn't expect that and that fixed it because i think he was the dad anyway,Michael
9057,2,there are dozens of old complaints in here cold cases like the show and toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve well you know what i have a problem with that and i'm going to open up these cases before toby can kill or rape another person,Michael
9059,2,that's not bad hey do you do weddings,Pam
9061,2,not bad,Jim
9062,2,i gave her a higher clearance than you,Dwight
9063,2,what does level red mean,Jim

9079,2,excuse me how long is the wait for a table for two,Jim

9118,2,it'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering,Oscar
9119,2,well oscar if you don't like it then you should concentrate on winning because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice and they will get a mini-fridge compliments of vance refrigeration,Michael

9473,2,my charity is the lackawanna county volunteer sheriff's department because dwight's a volunteer sheriff so i thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him,Jim
9474,2,i don't believe that jim moved that coat rack but if he did he has an obligation to use his gift wisely with great power comes great responsibility they could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more but i don't think it's true though,Dwight

9482,2,our numbers are down yes but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton hardworking motivated dynamic every single last one of them they follow my lead i sort of set the tone and it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate jan loves this branch and i think that's really more than half the battle,Michael
9483,2,it is extremely stressful planning a wedding by yourself it's like a job i mean it's fun but it kind of becomes like work i've already planned it all out in my head but it's just in my head,Pam

9503,3,exactly,Michael
9505,3,yeah i know,Michael
9507,3,ok a little too far crossed the line,Michael
9509,3,i would have never called him that if i knew you don't you don't call retarded people 'retards' it's bad taste you call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded and i consider oscar a friend,Michael
9510,3,listen man i am so sorry i had no idea,Michael
9511,3,no it's fine,Oscar
9512,3,no no it's not i feel terrible about it i have been calling people 'faggie' since i was in junior high and i have never made this mistake if i don't know how to behave it is because i am just so far the opposite way you know i'm just i i can't even imagine the thing maybe we could go out for a beer sometime and you could tell me how you do that to another dude,Michael
9513,3,that sounds like a great wonderful idea let's do that,Oscar
9514,3,it explains so much,Angela
9515,3,no i'm not gay and i don't understand why anyone would think that i'm gay if uh yeah i'm gay,Oscar
9516,3,i can't say whether dunder mifflin paper is less flammable sir but i can assure that it is certainly not more flammable,Jim

9536,3,yeah i'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay,Michael
9537,3,hey what about angela she's hard and severe she could be a gay woman,Michael
9538,3,i really don't think so,Dwight
9539,3,i don't know i can imagine her with another woman can't you,Michael
9541,3,do some research find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them,Michael
9542,3,jim told me you could buy gay-dar online,Dwight
9543,3,that's ridiculous,Michael
9544,3,yeah probably he didn't tell the truth a lot,Dwight
9545,3,let's call him and get the website,Michael
9546,3,definitely,Dwight

9575,3,anything's possible,Michael
9577,3,well i'm not gay jan and you should know that better than anybody,Michael

9590,3,we're all homos homosapiens gays aren't necessarily who you think they are people i mean anybody could be gay business-men like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants oscar why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it go ahead stand up i'm doing this for you,Michael
9591,3,yes i'm gay and i didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever can i sit down now,Oscar
9593,3,who should be the judges and juries of our society,Michael
9594,3,judges and juries,Angela
9595,3,yes that's a good point she has a good point because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could you know sounds pretty good right,Michael
9596,3,: that sounds great,Kevin
9597,3,i think all the other office gays should identify themselves or i will do it for them,Dwight

9610,3,no no no the only signal that i am sending is:,Michael
9611,3,look if i was gay i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just i would be waving that rainbow flag,Michael
9612,3,i don't think i can work here any longer this has been the worst most backwards day of my life,Oscar
9613,3,you misunderstand-- ok you know what ok i uh i'm gonna put my money where my mouth is you ready i am going to embrace oscar you might want to watch this angela because you can't catch anything here we go we are going to make a statement you and i are going to make a statement together oscar is my friend ---,Michael

9622,3,oh come on dwight come on man,Michael
9623,3,we are not in the playground anymore there are new rules we have to be mature but we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder what is love anyway maybe it's supposed to break all the rules like me and jan or oscar and some guy life is short when two people find each other what should stand in their way,Michael
9624,3,i am glad that today spurred social change that's part of my job as regional manager but you know what even if it didn't at least we put this matter to bed that's what she said or he said,Michael
9625,3,oh there's gill oscar's roommate i wonder if he knows,Michael
9626,3,i was going to quit but jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car all i had to do was sign something saying i won't sue gill and i are going to europe kids sometimes it pays to be gay,Oscar

10364,3,when i die i wanna be frozen and if they have to freeze me in pieces so be it i will wake up stronger than ever because i will have used that time to figure out exactly why i died and what moves i could have used to defend myself better now that i know what hold he had me in,Dwight
10365,3,i don't understand we have a day honoring martin luther king but he didn't even work here,Michael
10367,3,you really don't get it do you you don't understand these people that is the last thing that they would want is a day off,Michael
10369,3,a statue,Michael
10371,3,yeah,Michael
10373,3,well i think it would be very realistic it would look just like him,Michael
10375,3,we could have his eyes light up we could have his arms move,Michael
10376,3,that is not a statue that is a robot,Dwight
10377,3,i think that is a great way to honor ed,Michael
10378,3,and how big do you want this robot,Dwight

10415,3,there are five stages to grief which are denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance and right now out there they're all denying the fact that they're sad and that's hard and it's making them all angry and it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance and if not acceptance then just depression if i can get them depressed then i'll have done my job,Michael
10416,3,i am going to throw you this ball when you catch the ball i want you to say the name of a person very important to you somebody really special who died and then i want you to say how they died and you may cry if you like that is encouraged let me just start let me show you how this works i catch the ball i lost ed truck and it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears and at the same time somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone and i'm crying and nobody can hear me because i am terribly terribly terribly alone,Michael
10418,3,okay fine hurry back,Michael
10420,3,oh i would like a break,Pam

10483,3,it's okay it's okay shh yes i know i know it's been a tough day but it's good to let it show,Michael
10485,3,argh gah,Dwight
10486,3,what are what are you doing,Michael
10487,3,what no this is about the right size,Dwight
10488,3,no god no it's not what is the matter with you is that the beak,Michael
10489,3,i'm sorry i grew up on a farm we slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon my grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum it would have fit if he had given me another minute,Dwight
10490,3,i need a box i need a box a small box not too confining,Dwight
10491,3,is it for the bird,Pam
10492,3,yeah,Dwight
10493,3,i have it covered,Pam
10494,3,oh thank you,Dwight
10495,3,if you wanna do something for the funeral,Pam
10496,3,yes please,Dwight
10497,3,maybe you could play a song on your recorder,Pam
10498,3,excellent,Dwight
10499,3,do you have it with you,Pam
10500,3,always,Dwight
10501,3,did i wake up this morning thinking i'd be throwing together a bird funeral you never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into,Pam
10503,3,where'd i find what,Jim
10504,3,i called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door,Jim
10505,3,glad you could all make it,Michael
10507,3,dwight do you have the box,Michael
10508,3,actually i have it,Pam
10509,3,you made this wow that's that's very nice,Michael
10511,3,i'd also like to say a few words if that's okay,Pam
10512,3,yes,Michael
10513,3,what do we know about this bird you might think 'not much it's just a bird' but we do know some things we know it was a local bird maybe it's that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above,Pam
10514,3,oh i remember that that was so funny,Kevin
10515,3,and we know how he died flying into the glass doors but you know what i don't think he was being stupid i think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song,Pam
10516,3,he's not a songbird,Dwight
10517,3,shhh,Michael
10518,3,an impression then lastly we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesn't mean he was alone because i'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much he will not be forgotten,Pam
10519,3,amen,Angela
10521,3,just smile for me and let the day begin you are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love,Pam
10522,3,society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong well that's baloney because grief isn't wrong there is such a thing as good grief just ask charlie brown,Michael
10523,3,let's get back to work,Dwight
10525,3,umm sure,Jim
10527,3,he's so cute,Jim
10529,3,that's okay oh no it's not i'm sorry is that your husband in the tub with him,Jim
10531,3,sounds good,Jim
10533,3,oh wow he,Michael
10535,3,does his family know,Michael
10537,3,but i'm the first in the office,Michael
10539,3,okay yes sure i will do that,Michael
10541,3,cause i'm the first to to find out nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them well good how are you holding up want me to come over,Michael
10542,3,ed truck died and it blows they say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so i've had more time to be sad,Michael
10543,3,attention everyone as you know ed truck is dead if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook remove it now also if you have any photographs pam will make her shredder available during lunch that is all,Dwight
10544,3,remembering the dead doesn't help anybody the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again in this case some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body i'm working on both,Dwight
10545,3,i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor we need to find out what is blocking you and that way we'll be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored may he rest in peace,Michael
10546,3,ces,Kevin
10547,3,what was that kevin,Michael
10548,3,nothing,Kevin
10549,3,no you said something didn't you,Michael
10550,3,may he rest in pieces you know because there's like two pieces of him,Kevin
10551,3,you think that's funny,Michael
10552,3,no,Kevin
10553,3,you are disgusting,Michael
10554,3,michael no need to call corporate we are supposed to use toby he's trained as a grief counselor,Dwight
10555,3,no that can't be right,Michael
10557,3,well then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world doesn't it,Michael
10559,3,hi,Pam
10561,3,well i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone i've never met,Pam
10563,3,closer to the epicenter i guess,Pam
10566,3,not really,Kevin
10567,3,you're ruining it already they should not be given the choice,Michael
10570,3,no,Kevin
10574,3,wow wow no no you are the most heartless soulless person i've ever met,Michael
10576,3,no no shh enough it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here dwight ryan i want you to take the table out we're gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back we're going to start with a clean slate and in the interim i would like you to forget everything that toby has said okay,Michael
10577,3,i don't think i'm overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company and he is worthless you give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would grief counseling is not about 'are you hungry would you like a sandwich' these people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats,Michael
10578,3,okay part of the problem was that toby talked at you now i am going to talk with you first off i want you to be comfortable because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up so guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want ladies let your hair down you know what even take your shoes off i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said,Michael
10579,3,okay i don't think kevin should take his shoes off,Angela
10580,3,my feet do not smell angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition,Kevin
10581,3,i found an exercise in toby's binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says 'i don't wanna do that i don't wanna talk about that that is too private' here's how it works i'm going to throw you this ball,Michael
10584,3,really,Pam
10586,3,wow i thought that was supposed to be like next month,Pam
10588,3,yeah i'd love to see them oh and tell them i say 'congratulations',Pam
10590,3,i should probably head back in,Pam
10592,3,but umm thanks for the break,Pam
10595,3,michael once told me that home alone is the saddest movie ever when i asked him why he said 'because the whole family forgets the kid at home there is nothing funny about that',Pam
10596,3,that's hold it hold it hold it start like right in there just dig,Michael
10597,3,ow god,Dwight
10598,3,okay give it to me you don't know what you're doing all right,Michael
10600,3,nothing let's just all right guys do you have a box we could use,Michael

10919,3,really you do i love the material,Pam
10921,3,how come you didn't get me one,Michael
10924,3,i actually might not go feeling kind of tired,Pam

10940,3,wha really you should it's fun,Michael
10941,3,i love the people here and if there was one thing i di don't really care for is that they can be terribly terribly ignorant about other cultures and i don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend carol,Michael
10942,3,diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus but frankly i'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture so without further ado kelly you are on,Michael
10944,3,kelly,Michael
10946,3,um why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday,Michael
10948,3,how many gods do you have,Angela

10957,3,thank you,Jim
10958,3,now a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million and that's true but it's also not true because frankly there are literally billions of people just like kelly in the world here are some famous indians subrahmanyan chandrasekhar he is a nobel prize-winning physicist impressive apu from the simpsons hilarious indian m night shyamalan 'the village' 'unbreakable' 'sixth sense' 'sig ',Michael

11830,3,no we do have to get along can't we all just get along or have we forgotten the words of the reverend king,Michael

11848,3,this is egregious this is egregious,Michael
11857,3,see that mission accomplished like a bunch of fourth graders sometimes what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady although that'll change because by the end of the fourth grade the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most jell-o,Michael

15752,3,that is correct,Dwight

16328,3,who's amanda bynes,Michael
16330,3,oh i love that movie yes kelly is right the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope so without further ado jim and dwight show us what you got,Michael
16331,3,hey i know what you're looking for but um i got to be honest i really don't think i should be considered as your replacement,Jim

17183,4,what are you,Michael
17185,4,ok 1 sikh and,Michael
17186,4,as a farmer i know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery with the electricity we're using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days you tell me what's unethical,Dwight
17187,4,blink once if you want me to pull the plug,Dwight
17192,4,are you a doctor or a male nurse,Dwight

17197,4,just doing my job,Dwight
17200,4,you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car and it's not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesn't make any sense god is dead,Michael
17202,4,maybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine,Michael
17203,4,i will do some research,Jim
17204,4,i can help you with that,Pam

17210,4,this place is so cursed,Michael
17211,4,actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in lock jaw,Dwight
17212,4,i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her with my car but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it,Michael
17213,4,six of one really,Jim
17214,4,turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life curse is broken curse is broken people oh there is a god and he has a plan for us after all so go home get some rest very very good work today we got a lot accomplished,Michael
17215,4,is there a god if not what are all the churches for and who is jesus' dad,Michael

17241,4,ok well back in olden times a large fat person like this was a person of power a person who had money could buy food person of respect like the regional manager of the day whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was someone who worked in the fields and i was a peasant,Michael
17242,4,i just don't want to run i didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes,Kevin
17243,4,well you're going to have to run or you're going to be in a lot of trouble it is not olden times anymore,Michael

17280,4,you'll feel better after the 5k exercise is good for depression,Dwight
17281,4,i'm not depressed i'm in grief,Angela
17282,4,we have raised almost $70000 most of it from me and jan um when do they put that on the giant check or is that something that we write in later,Michael
17283,4,well a giant check costs about $20000 to make up i have a print shop standing by but what do you think michael that's over 25% of our funds,Pam
17284,4,hmm that's a tough decision um i always imagined it with a giant check so,Michael
17285,4,yeah i mean i personally am definitely on board for the giant check,Jim
17286,4,giant check it is,Pam
17287,4,yeah,Jim
17288,4,yep,Michael
17289,4,well i don't know on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control,Dwight
17290,4,bat birth control,Jim
17291,4,wait this money is going to bat birth control right michael that's what you told me when i contributed,Dwight
17292,4,you didn't contribute very much i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor and how's that been going,Michael
17293,4,not well a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $70000 or $50000 if we go with the giant check,Pam
17294,4,which we are,Jim
17295,4,and also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor,Pam
17296,4,what about a rabies nurse,Michael
17297,4,i don't think so,Pam
17298,4,you know what though i've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour for parties and bachelor events,Jim
17299,4,that's possible look into that,Michael
17300,4,great it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah oh actually more with tips,Jim
17301,4,maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for meredith's son,Dwight
17302,4,have you met that kid he's not going to college,Michael
17303,4,michael 5k means 5 kilometers not 5 thousand miles,Pam

17321,4,see how i did that that's the way you should enter a room you knock and then you wait for the all clear,Michael
17322,4,you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room,Jim
17323,4,yes but i have an office so why would i do that,Michael
17324,4,on average how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office just ballpark,Pam
17325,4,european offices are naked all the time,Michael

17331,4,alright,Jim
17332,4,they say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked i do not recommend this strategy try picturing them with more clothes on or a funny coat,Pam

17452,4,hey mer how ya doing,Michael

17502,4,on the one hand it's a relief to know that it's not just me the whole office is cursed on the other hand i may have to deal with the dark unknown,Michael
17503,4,question: has anyone recently offended a gypsy,Dwight
17504,4,we have to have done something wrong,Michael

17511,4,michael do you know what secular humanism is,Oscar
17512,4,yes it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition,Michael
17513,4,oh,Oscar
17514,4,stupid,Michael
17515,4,my cousin mose's best friend was a dog one day he was foaming at the mouth so i had to shoot him dead turns out he had only eaten one of mose's cream pies did i feel bad for killing him no that's how you deal with a thief,Dwight
17516,4,yeah the uh the charity's having some financial problems what do i look like to you paul newman that's actually not a good example because i have been compared to a young paul newman my eyes and my face and i make my own salad dressing i mix newman's ranch with newman's italian sell it at flea markets for a slight loss i could make i could make a profit if i changed one of the ingredients to wishbone but i won't do it,Michael

18095,4,that was slightly harsh don't you think,Jim
18097,4,i think i know what's going on ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now and there isn't but um don't tell him don't tell him that i don't want to jeopardize our friendship,Michael
18098,4,ryan is causing some problems and you were always good at handling him what should i do to control him,Michael

18106,4,my generation's all about hard work and accomplishment like the moon landing or vietnam rolling stones greatest band ever,Michael
18107,4,you're forty-three mick jagger's like sixty-five,Oscar
18108,4,and still rockin' oscar one of the greatest all-time oldies was a little oriental guy named confucius he literally invented the ancient chinese secret here's some of his quotes confucius say 'man who farts in church must sit in his own pew' confucius say 'man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day' confucius also say 'virgin like balloon one prick all gone',Michael
18109,4,did you google confucius and just print out the first thing you saw,Oscar
18110,4,no i skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page which proves that he was old but he was also hilarious,Michael
18112,4,i'm not it's solitaire see,Michael
18113,4,blackberry why would anyone name something like this after a fruit you wouldn't name an ipod after a fruit excuse me while i type on my banana i'm gonna go to the orange store and buy an apricot computer apple,Michael
18114,4,this is going on the outside the pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner do not tape those on,Michael
18115,4,hey michael,Pam
18116,4,mmhmm,Michael
18117,4,jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner she wants you to call her,Pam
18118,4,i'm a little busy right now could you blackberry me a message,Michael
18119,4,sure,Pam
18120,4,michael doesn't know how to work his blackberry so when he says blackberry me a message he means write it on a post-it note and stick it to his blackberry,Pam
18122,4,you didn't set up your blackberry dwight,Jim
18123,4,yes i did but i do not intend to use it it is pointless technology,Dwight
18124,4,as opposed to,Jim
18125,4,printing press tractor mechanical thresher telephone airplane the only inventions that matter,Dwight
18126,4,what about cars,Jim
18127,4,they fall under the category of airplanes,Dwight
18128,4,they do so cars are flightless airplanes,Jim
18129,4,correct,Dwight
18130,4,got it they're like the penguins of the airplane family,Jim
18131,4,that's an excellent analogy,Dwight
18132,4,thanks,Jim
18133,4,hey dwight what about vaccines,Pam
18134,4,vaccines are for chumps,Dwight
18135,4,my mom didn't believe in vaccines i got my smallpox the old-fashioned way and i survived so joke's on you hospitals,Dwight
18136,4,the one advantage to being older is that i know a few things about a few things and i am young enough to not forget them and old enough to know the difference between the two i am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws but young enough to date college girls but old enough to know better i'm at a perfect age i could die now but i won't because i am young,Michael
18138,4,hi creed what's up,Kevin
18140,4,i like your hair i don't know if i told you,Oscar

18144,4,i think i'll just take my chances,Oscar
18146,4,wha,Kevin
18147,4,and the same thing goes for quarterly reports they are unreadable they're just numbers and boring and blech so what i was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic like if we have a bad quarter put in a storm cloud and when we have a good quarter fireworks or a racecar doesn't have to be a racecar use your imagination,Michael
18148,4,there's this cube on the screen and it bounces around all day and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away and we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room okay i believe she thinks she saw it,Jim
18149,4,i saw it i saw it and it was amazing who said i didn't see it did jim say that i didn't see it i saw it,Pam
18150,4,we have a lot of colored paper here why oh why do we keep printing this on white,Michael
18151,4,dah come on,Andy

18153,4,it's never gonna happen,Oscar
18154,4,dude you gotta believe,Kevin
18155,4,maybe we could have some sort of riddle,Michael
18156,4,wait for it,Jim
18157,4,like something that you have to look for sort of a 'where's waldo',Michael

19566,4,okay okay who could do music,Michael
19567,4,how about darryl,Pam
19568,4,actually i'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a celestine prophesy and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano,Michael
19569,4,michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative which i think is odd because michael actually might be the most creative person i've ever known every day michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before,Jim

19945,4,dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness,Michael
19946,4,oh,Pam
19947,4,where he will then leave me to either die or to survive the choice is yours,Michael

19953,4,when i return i hope to be a completely changed human being,Michael
19954,4,that'd be great,Jim
19955,4,do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment let's put it this way: no i do not,Dwight
19956,4,this is what a true survivor man does you simulate a disaster like a plane wreck you could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets now in this case this disaster is a serial killer creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead,Michael
19957,4,no i would never leave you for dead you would never escape,Dwight
19958,4,well yes i would and i would survive,Michael
19959,4,i would make sure that you were dead,Dwight
19960,4,well,Michael
19961,4,first i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified,Dwight
19962,4,you,Michael
19963,4,and they would call me the overkill killer,Dwight
19964,4,you you are as creepy as a real serial killer for real ok,Michael
19965,4,what are you doing,Dwight
19966,4,i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings now this way i can't retrace my steps i don't know what streets we've been--- ow what are you doing,Michael
19967,4,it would be better if you were unconscious,Dwight
19968,4,no gosh dwight stop it stop it stop it,Michael
19969,4,do you want to do this right or not,Dwight
19970,4,just please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life,Michael

19976,4,you know what i have an idea why don't we just do one big shared party,Jim
19977,4,what,Angela
19978,4,there are thirteen people working in this office so thirteen times a year michael gets a cake and balloons and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast there are two types of toasts one is a joke about how old you are,Jim
19979,4,look at those wrinkles blacks do crack not crack the drug,Michael
19980,4,and the other is something inappropriate or horrible or both what else he only sings the high harmony to 'happy birthday' and he's a very big believer in surprise parties maybe even arguably possibly to a fault,Jim
19981,4,happy birthday,Michael
19983,4,happy birthday,Michael
19984,4,ahhh,Oscar
19985,4,happy birthday,Michael
19987,4,so i think yeah i think getting these out of the way might be productive,Jim

19989,4,i don't like it,Angela
19990,4,wow you're shaking things up a bit huh,Pam

20774,4,i'm sorry she scares me,Jim
20775,4,michael's dinner party is for couples only which is why i wasn't initially invited but that was then i very recently entered into a serious monogamous relationship if that idiot ever gets here,Dwight

20782,4,yes,Michael
20784,4,so she's passed out and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog,Michael
20786,4,and the neighbors blamed jan,Michael
20788,4,it's like you know the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place anyway it's a tragedy really because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds,Michael
20790,4,so,Michael
20792,4,well,Michael
20794,4,what's that,Jim
20799,4,wb jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get,Pam
20800,4,so we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there,Jim

20810,4,pam when i first opened this catalog i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair,Michael
20811,4,but instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair,Pam
20812,4,michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago and normally i wouldn't care but he promised me his old one it's way better it's one of these i really want it,Pam

20818,4,or in a great chair,Pam
20819,4,oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women,Michael
20820,4,i definitely remember your dinner party,Pam
20821,4,i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman jan i think that fate put this catalog in my hands,Michael
20822,4,actually i put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair,Pam
20823,4,what is it like being single i like it i like starting each day with a sense of possibility and i'm optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results,Michael
20824,4,ladies and gentleman would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85,Michael
20826,4,no he hasn't picked one yet,Pam
20829,4,i am ready to start dating again getting back on the market so fyi for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends use the woman on page 85 as a template that will be all,Michael

21685,4,all right you don't respect me i accept that but listen to me you can't talk to me that way in this office you just can't i am your boss can't allow it,Michael
21687,4,i am good person and sometimes good people don't get no respect rodney dangerfield hey i don't get no respect no respect at all when i was in the sandbox as a kid i got not respect my wife likes to talk after sex so she called me from a hotel room and said 'i don't respect you' ahh thoughtless aw you know what don't get no respect airplane food why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food my wife don't get no respect some--take her please for example if you don't get no respect you might be redneck respect is niiice borat what's the deal with grapenuts no grapes no nuts i don't get no respect,Michael

21691,4,dammit phyllis alright everybody out except phyllis,Michael

21694,4,everybody he just he's always he's always talking about people behind their backs to me,Michael
21695,4,what kind of stuff does stanley say,Pam
21696,4,like that people are stupid and that they're idiots and that they're sluts,Michael
21698,4,because he's mean he's he's like a really mean-spirited guy he talks about how gay oscar is,Michael

21703,4,she's never worn these glasses before,Jim
21704,4,well he's just mean,Michael
21705,4,michael i think that what stanley did to you was rude maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly,Pam
21706,4,it's complicated pam i mean the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk,Michael
21707,4,well i actually agree with her i think you should talk to him and you also might want to explain to andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash,Jim
21709,4,okay,Michael

24873,5,how did i propose let me see well i drove her up to nashua and i had the ring a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful and i got down on my hands and knees and a shooting star crossed overhead and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star and we were in a restaurant and i put the diamond into a cheeseburger,Michael

24876,5,perfect,Jim
24877,5,the ring 10-carat diamond pops out of her mouth hits her shrimp cocktail right onto her finger million-to-one shot all of the greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'opa' which means 'congratulations' so,Michael
24878,5,oh man,Andy
24879,5,ask how he's doing since the breakup,Pam
24880,5,so how you holdin' up,Jim

24885,5,tell him you'd like to go with him,Pam
24886,5,we should take a look at those surveys,Jim
24887,5,why are surveys important okay hypothetical: a man wants to buy 500 reams ofcarrots and so he's like 'what do i do where do i go do i go to the insensitive carrot supplier the insensitive carrot salesman or do i go to the nice carrot salesman who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots most companies need their carrots the next day now substitute paper for carrots and that is why surveys are important',Michael
24888,5,great marks phyllis,Michael
24891,5,up don't leave me hangin',Andy
24892,5,what do i do with my bonus check simple purchase paper from myself boosts my sales which boosts my bonus last year i bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger eventually i'll get a bonus so big i can retire on it and i'll use the paper to write my memoirs,Dwight
24893,5,i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales but there are certain things that cannot be taught and it is these things that i now must teach them,Michael

24898,5,dwight and i are both writing letters to our clients i'm just sending a quick note to say how much i appreciate their business and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation it's just different styles,Jim
24899,5,my job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper in return they give me money i am the predator and they are the prey would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk should the hawk even care excuse me i've got work to do,Dwight
24902,5,hey what are you laughing at,Dwight
24904,5,are you laughing at me,Dwight
24907,5,how is that funny what are you really laughing at huh,Dwight
24910,5,there's no way you're laughing at this,Dwight
24911,5,oh i don't have anything to say i'm just hiding from dwight,Jim
24913,5,it's good to be paranoid people need to be more paranoid case in point jfk if i had been jfk i would have seen all three gunmen i would have pulled out my concealed luger and fired first man in book depository boom grassy knoll boom fake jackie boom then i shoot myself so i don't change history and create a paradox boom but right at the last minute i twist out of the way of the bullet nice try history better luck next year,Dwight
24914,5,so as it turns out dwight is right how bizarre,Jim
24915,5,i wonder what else dwight's been right about,Pam
24916,5,major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative,Dwight
24917,5,the scranton zoning board has a strong bias against beet farmers the mayor is in the pocket of big lettuce,Dwight
24918,5,battlestar galactica isn't a documentary exactly,Dwight

24922,5,did you know that in morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom this is considered to be polite,Michael

25836,5,hey michael what's 394 times 5912,Kevin
25837,5,let's see,Michael
25838,5,you're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs,Pam

26458,5,okay,Michael
26459,5,then we meet at the denny's,Dwight

26470,5,store only has three employees,Dwight

26472,5,it means they are not expanding,Dwight
26473,5,maybe they are shrinking,Michael
26474,5,no,Dwight
26475,5,they could be shrinking,Michael
26476,5,no because their sign is centered perfectly above their store no sign of the sign being moved,Dwight
26477,5,ah ha yup,Michael
26478,5,its lunch time and no sign of anyone coming in or out which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch,Dwight
26479,5,mm hmm,Michael
26480,5,which means they're not acquiring new business so once again no growth,Dwight
26481,5,and there are clouds there are clouds in the sky which means gonna rain bad for business,Michael
26482,5,oh it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus,Dwight
26483,5,argh why are you all,Michael
26484,5,get your clouds right,Dwight

26488,5,yeah,Dwight
26489,5,good here come the sharks,Michael
26490,5,in nature there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark and the little shark eats a littler shark and so on and so on until you get down to the single cell shark so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business,Michael
26491,5,hello,Michael
26493,5,my name is michael scarn i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company,Michael

26499,5,you know i will be honest with you about something where we used to live our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and i just didn't feel like a priority so i guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have,Michael
26501,5,really that many this doesn't seem like a very big operation,Michael
26503,5,ah so when did you set up shop,Michael
26505,5,oh vietnam i hear it's lovely,Michael
26507,5,each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments topic: hillary swank is attractive,Andy

26526,5,me too,Dwight
26527,5,i think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures you know we don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people,Jim

27923,5,i've written these things because it is my responsibility as manager of this branch to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion now it is your turn i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine umm hmm,Michael

28033,5,impossible,Dwight
28034,5,yes you did,Michael
28035,5,i wasn't given candy as a child so a movie that fetish-ized it that much would have made no sense to me plus we weren't allowed to see movies so do the math,Dwight

28066,5,well,Dwight
28067,5,i mean like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion,Michael
28068,5,we discussed the fact that i'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world,Dwight
28069,5,right,Michael
28070,5,no plowing my own acres going around shirtless all day you know experiencing freedom,Dwight

28413,5,hey,Jim
28415,5,alright charles i've gotta be honest i think we really got off on the wrong foot here and truth be told i'm a pretty smart guy and uh a hard-worker and a great number two for the office,Jim
28417,5,second-in-command to michael,Jim
28419,5,oh that's because at first it was a made up position for dwight just to make him feel better assistant to the regional manager but then he lost that and michael gave it to me,Jim
28421,5,assistant regional manager yeah,Jim
28423,5,no not exactly,Jim

28434,5,cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party just pulled the rug out from under me and he said no figs i've already bought em and i don't have a place to store them so i feel like i've been sort of boned,Michael
28436,5,do you talk to him about this you've talked to him all day obviously did you talk to him about this,Michael
28438,5,ok then i don't get it it doesn't make any sense to me because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles and then charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again,Michael
28440,5,clearly that's what you wanted,Michael
28442,5,fifteen years i have been here and i have sacrificed a lot,Michael
28444,5,i've put having a family on hold,Michael
28446,5,and i've never gone hang-gliding and i've never driven my car to the top of mount washington,Michael

28461,5,charles and kelly absolutely not he is a sophisticated man he does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship ok,Angela
28462,5,i don't understand that after fifteen years of service here i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you that doesn't seem right to me that doesn't seem fair and i think that i've earned more than that,Michael
28464,5,ok,Michael
28466,5,i quit,Michael
28468,5,you have no idea how high i can fly,Michael
28469,5,i'm telling you when corporate sends somebody it is big trouble or really good news and then sometimes it means business as usual,Andy
28471,5,well it's-,Oscar
28472,5,why are you asking him i just told you why he's here,Andy
28474,5,dunder mifflin,Oscar
28476,5,i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit i got on that ramp and i thought two hours two hours to go feeling good listen to some tunes should've peed before i left,Michael
28478,5,okay so i get up to the building i get to the revolving door broken so i have to take the normal door,Michael
28479,5,at least he is in the building,Oscar

28484,5,i looked at wallace and i said 'i quit' and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said 'you have no idea how high i can fly',Michael
28486,5,why would i do that,Michael
28487,5,well wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent,Angela

28490,5,you guys have thought about this a lot more than i have i just winged it,Michael

29570,5,la la la continuing notice my persistence and recall continuing you called dunder mifflin and your order was filled within an hour,Dwight
29571,5,i'm going to pull a date out of the air right now april 13th 2002 that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs is it not we all know that the economy is bad and bloated companies like dunder mifflin,Michael
29572,5,come on,Dwight
29573,5,are going to fall by the wayside two of their branches have closed within the last year the michael scott paper company however has opened a new branch this very month,Michael

29582,5,how is tom the homosexual sophomore,Dwight
29583,5,i wanted to start a company not a war because in a war you always fight those you are closest to and the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother for what what purpose did that serve apart from abolishing slavery in that case war was the right choice this doesn't feel as important though that's just how the world works i guess,Michael
29584,5,he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good and if a friend can't make you feel good then i don't want any friends except dwight because he is our only source of fertile leads,Michael
29585,5,dwight just got howard family dry cleaners,Michael
29587,5,he's undercutting us big time he's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket,Michael

29594,5,it's good but won't it feel weird cutting into a cross,Pam
29595,5,don't think of it as a cross in the judeo-christian sense think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage,Andy
29596,5,when i think of it like that i do not think of the other connotations,Jim
29597,5,yes,Andy

31022,6,sure but we should get to the bottom of this let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning,Pam
31023,6,i need to do mine first who's been saying that there's another person inside of me working me with controls,Kevin
31025,6,i heard it from erin,Andy
31028,6,michael he's over here,Pam
31029,6,where are you going,Pam

31047,6,jim no no i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j crew model and i was referring to myself,Michael
31048,6,how is that a bad rumor,Angela
31049,6,because a lot of people think that models even though they're very attractive are somewhat vapid it's set our industry back quite a bit,Michael
31050,6,michael why why say all these things why make up an eating disorder stanley's affair me being a spokesdog,Oscar
31052,6,okay okay here's the thing there was one true rumor out there today i didn't want everybody to know what it was so all of you are off the hook except for this one person,Michael
31055,6,michael am i gay,Andy
31056,6,the one true rumor and this is going to ruin this person's life is that,Michael
31057,6,that pam's pregnant,Jim
31058,6,i knew it,Angela
31059,6,i knew it her breasts were a tiny bit bigger at first i thought 'oh she has a new bra with padding' but then i thought 'pam doesn't need padding' it just didn't add up jim,Kevin
31060,6,okay thank you,Jim
31064,6,who's the father,Dwight
31065,6,jim,Pam
31067,6,four months,Jim
31069,6,stop don't just,Pam
31070,6,alright alright you know this is not the truth and you can't fall on the sword this way the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair,Michael
31071,6,nope,Jim
31072,6,yes jim,Michael
31073,6,thank you for trying to defend her but actually pam is pregnant and we can prove it,Jim
31074,6,yes,Pam
31075,6,if everyone would like to see proof,Jim
31076,6,okay,Pam
31080,6,look at that that is the inside of your vagina,Michael
31081,6,it's clear why we were trying not to tell people that's clear now,Pam
31082,6,how long have you known about the pregnancy,Michael
31084,6,a week a month a year,Michael
31085,6,michael we only told our parents last week,Jim
31086,6,did you pee on a stick,Michael
31087,6,i did it was inconclusive,Jim
31088,6,you should've told me,Michael
31089,6,you're right we should've realized that you are an equal part of this,Pam
31093,6,you called stanley's wife,Pam
31094,6,oh oh yeah a long time ago just to make sure she was out of town oh oh god,Michael
31095,6,don't take it,Jim
31096,6,no i have to take it or it'll seem suspicious,Michael
31097,6,if you talk to her you're gonna tell her about stanley and that's gonna seem more suspicious,Pam
31098,6,no no i can do this,Michael
31099,6,you can't do this,Jim
31100,6,yes i can i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo and i need her help we will haggle about money and then i will back down and then i won't talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over,Michael
31101,6,that sounds terrible,Jim
31102,6,michael please don't,Pam
31103,6,hey what up cynthia,Michael
31105,6,hold on a second cynthia,Michael
31107,6,well it turns out that teri was already suspicious because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago so stanley promised that he would stop and he did end of story well not exactly uhh cynthia kept calling him she would not stop calling him and she was in love with him oh and get this cynthia also married so you can't stop love i guess and quite frankly i don't think you should ever try,Michael

31216,6,oui oui monsieur from the wisconsin region a nice firm cheddar also from the great state of wisconsin an aged parmesan here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which i think you'll find both challenging and delicious at that point i would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of illinois where you will find this fine bleu cheese dressing if i may be so bold it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese bon appetit,Andy

31428,6,welcome,Michael
31429,6,thank you i've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings,Jim
31430,6,mm-hmm,Michael
31431,6,and i'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit um--,Jim
31432,6,disruptive,Michael
31433,6,yes,Jim
31434,6,no i don't think they are i think the meetings are very important,Michael
31435,6,okay maybe we should talk specifics,Jim
31436,6,let's do,Michael
31437,6,okay yesterday we had a meeting about planets,Jim
31438,6,n-- well to be fair jim james jimothy to be fair jimothy the-- ah that sounds weird are you okay with being called jim,Michael
31439,6,i am,Jim
31440,6,alright jim to be fair the conversation wasn't about planets,Michael
31441,6,right,Jim
31442,6,at first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw a line from there to the other planets and i think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are,Michael
31443,6,yes i agree,Jim
31444,6,because it's a big universe and we're all just little tiny specks of dust,Michael
31445,6,i just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day,Jim
31446,6,you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep it's light out you wake up it's dark that's the whole day where did that day go i have no idea,Michael
31447,6,you mean on a weekend,Jim
31448,6,yes,Michael
31449,6,how about this i think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential,Jim
31450,6,alright no more meetings this week,Michael
31451,6,really you just agreed to that,Jim
31452,6,i can be very suprising,Michael
31454,6,i need to fit into my wedding dress however i'm also pregnant,Pam
31457,6,we did but mostly because people expect us to we're also accepting other gifts not on the registry however much,Pam
31458,6,it's awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesn't crate & barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash,Pam
31460,6,oh good,Pam
31462,6,no we're not,Pam
31464,6,mm-hmm,Michael
31465,6,okay i thought i saw people missing,Jim
31466,6,yeah just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks got one of each,Michael
31467,6,really hey stanley what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door,Jim
31468,6,stanley you don't need to answer that,Michael
31469,6,stanley,Jim
31471,6,okay michael i thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these,Jim
31472,6,what do you mean by 'these people',Michael
31473,6,michael this is a conference room meeting,Jim
31474,6,oh hey everybody i think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room,Michael
31475,6,that's not what i meant,Jim
31476,6,listen jim no offense but when push comes to shove what i want is more important that what you want,Michael
31477,6,i disagree,Jim
31478,6,what do you guys think,Michael
31479,6,great guys can i just have a moment alone with michael,Jim
31480,6,no no no you don't need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people,Michael
31481,6,that is not what i said and also i am co-manager meaning you are not the only manager anymore i am also i co-manager,Jim
31482,6,that is not what wallace told us,Michael
31483,6,that's exactly what wallace told us,Jim
31484,6,that is not the way i heard it,Michael
31486,6,it is one thing me giving you the co-manager title it is another thing you bossing me around,Michael
31487,6,i'm not bossing you around i'm trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallace,Jim
31488,6,no no no no we will not call david wallace i will call david wallace,Michael
31490,6,or david wallace will call us on line two why don't we just--,Michael
31491,6,hey david you got jim here,Jim
31492,6,hey david this is michael senior co-manager,Michael
31494,6,got it dave sounds like your classice big-picture decision,Michael
31495,6,which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees,Jim
31497,6,which is it more of,Michael
31499,6,david i know that i'm very new at this but i have a very good perspective on how things work,Jim
31501,6,i thought maybe we could talk after this is over,Michael
31503,6,nope not at all,Jim
31504,6,no it will not be i am on top of it,Michael
31506,6,alright thanks alot david,Jim
31507,6,talk to you later-- okay you didn't let me say good-bye alright i am looking forward to this,Michael
31508,6,you don't have to lie,Jim
31509,6,i hate the fact that we have to do this together i think we work better separately when i am irritated and i look at you i don't see you anymore,Michael
31510,6,right,Jim
31511,6,all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are,Michael
31512,6,alright let's get started,Jim
31515,6,you know there's no easy way to do this i say we add 15% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it,Michael
31516,6,do you mean like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll,Jim
31517,6,no we can do it during the day it doesn't have to be that dramatic jim,Michael
31518,6,okay you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options,Jim
31519,6,jim don't take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong way,Michael
31520,6,it's hard to tell so far,Jim
31521,6,you use your brain too much,Michael
31522,6,i'm sorry are you advocating that i use it less,Jim
31523,6,sometimes the smartest people don't think at all,Michael
31524,6,you just came up with that,Jim
31525,6,as i was saying it,Michael
31526,6,yeah okay so for the 15% increase pro-- everyone gets a little bit,Jim
31527,6,con-- you look like a nerd,Michael
31528,6,con-- no one gets as much as they did last year,Jim
31529,6,pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds,Michael
31530,6,pro-- no favoritism,Jim
31531,6,con-- you unzip your pants and you find that there's a calculator down there,Michael
31532,6,i've been studying michael for years and i've condensed what i've learned into this chart-- how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking i made it bigger so that you could see it,Jim
31533,6,hey pam i heard that you were registered but i didn't hear where,Kevin
31534,6,i don't think we registered anywhere we just want cash,Pam
31535,6,like money like you-- you want my money,Kevin
31536,6,mm-hmm,Pam
31537,6,will you take a check,Kevin
31538,6,yeah,Pam

31540,6,okay,Pam
31541,6,wait til' monday,Kevin
31542,6,is this what i've become materialistic shallow i feel horrible oh look 'mrs pam halpert' that's the first time i've seen it in writing,Pam
31543,6,you know the more i think about it the more i think we should give it to the salesmen,Jim
31544,6,that will not go over well,Michael
31545,6,i know i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now 'course i know that this might come off as biased so you know what let us,Jim
31546,6,oh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list i'm gonna kill myself,Michael
31547,6,i'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking,Jim
31548,6,no i could not do that jim i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if i can just think this through if i could just think it exactly right i can make this perfect and then i can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue,Michael
31549,6,michael,Jim
31550,6,and then another--,Michael
31551,6,look you have a lot of strengths,Jim
31552,6,oh i do tell me what they are,Michael
31553,6,i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well,Jim
31554,6,ha that-- i am not known for that,Michael
31555,6,but there is a reason why i'm here,Jim
31556,6,yes you went over my head to wallace,Michael
31557,6,no it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses michael,Jim
31558,6,okay well why don't you tell me what those are jim why don't you enliven me,Michael
31559,6,i don't think you're good at making tough decisions,Jim
31560,6,ah,Michael
31561,6,at thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when it's an unpopular decision,Jim
31562,6,okay here's a tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for you,Michael
31563,6,but maybe i'm here for a reason because i might have some good ideas too i've been sitting out there and i've been learning a lot and maybe i can just bring something different to the table,Jim
31564,6,okay skippy here we go why don't you run yourself out there and tell them you call it,Michael
31566,6,this had better be terrible,Michael
31567,6,could i have everyone's attention please i have some tough news so i'm just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people won't now what we've decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff,Jim
31569,6,look you guys are smart so i'm just leveling with you i'm just trying to treat you like adults,Jim
31570,6,thank you jim for thinking that we're smart people,Oscar
31571,6,but i do not understand if we're such smart adults then why don't we get raises,Angela
31572,6,excellent question genius it's because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with,Oscar
31573,6,ooh easy that's not it at all,Jim
31574,6,well,Oscar
31575,6,really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office,Jim
31577,6,jim is only giving raises to the salesmen,Kevin
31579,6,hold on kelly would it help you to know that jim thinks you're smart,Oscar
31581,6,this is ridiculous how could he do this to us,Dwight
31582,6,okay dwight you know what you'd be getting the raise so--,Jim
31583,6,what about all these people huh how is it fair to them,Dwight
31584,6,exactly,Oscar
31585,6,totally,Kevin
31586,6,we work just as hard as the sales people we deserve raises,Oscar
31588,6,yes they don't get 'em if we don't get 'em,Angela
31590,6,yeah,Kevin
31591,6,her kid needs shoes jim,Dwight
31593,6,wow i'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit so,Jim
31594,6,that was good that was good okay all right well we all know it's hard to be a boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heart-ons for you and that is a gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar a cup of sugar this--,Michael
31595,6,what are you talking about michael,Angela
31597,6,my plan-- a man-- panama,Michael
31598,6,that's not how that goes,Andy
31600,6,thank you meredith,Jim
31602,6,we would just like to know what's happening are we getting a raise yes or no,Oscar
31603,6,alright let me get this clear does everybody want a raise alright everyone wants a raise so what we're going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do,Michael
31604,6,again that gives us no information,Oscar
31606,6,what about a raise based on merit,Michael
31607,6,rank each person individually,Jim
31608,6,mm-hmm piece of cake ryan obviously the best,Michael
31609,6,well obviously too bad he's a temp and doesn't count so let's get started,Jim
31610,6,are you making a--,Michael
31611,6,nope i'm numbering the paper,Jim
31612,6,just--,Oscar
31613,6,yeah i don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us,Kevin
31614,6,it's not like we're not gonna see the checks we're in accounting,Angela
31616,6,and jim,Dwight
31618,6,i think it was creed,Dwight
31620,6,it's going really well actually,Jim
31621,6,each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise we each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that,Jim
31622,6,toby,Michael
31623,6,he's not a part of this you know that,Jim
31624,6,just wanted to draw a picture of him,Michael
31625,6,okay your move,Jim
31626,6,alright who to pick who to pick,Michael
31627,6,here we go,Jim
31628,6,i will skip a turn,Michael
31629,6,okay you're gonna still have to play that bean you know that,Jim
31630,6,i need more time,Michael
31632,6,people are starting to notice how terrible jim is it's great eventually they'll rise up and revolt my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later if the people here were our founding fathers the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years because stanley washington was napping and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly,Dwight
31633,6,come on in that's right come in feast your eyes they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces,Dwight
31634,6,what the hell,Oscar
31635,6,things were not this bad when just michael was manager,Dwight
31636,6,hey what are you guys doing in here,Michael
31637,6,what does a bean mean,Kevin
31638,6,why aren't there any beans on this very old frizzy-haired picture of me,Pam
31639,6,michael what does a bean mean,Kevin
31640,6,jim,Pam
31641,6,i was just trying to be unbiased,Jim
31642,6,what does a bean mean,Kevin
31643,6,someone please explain it to kevin,Oscar
31646,6,this is how you make this important decision,Angela
31647,6,there's no way that stanley gets more beans than me that is ridiculous this is how it works,Andy
31649,6,thank you that is exactly-- by the way i would also like a raise,Andy
31651,6,are we idiots what right does jim have to claim authority hmm is he as good a salesman as i is he as matronly as phyllis there are moments where we can affect change for a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds let us storm his castle come on tick-- let's get him tock-- let's get jim tick-- and drag jim out of his office tock-- take his keys away from him tick-- that's a clock the time is getting very close it's now or never what say you,Dwight
31653,6,no i mean what do you say to my plan okay,Dwight
31655,6,what does a bean mean,Kevin
31656,6,how you doing,Michael
31657,6,uh on a scale of one to ten i'd say i'm about a four,Jim
31658,6,oh what are you usually,Michael
31659,6,six you,Jim
31660,6,usually a ten but i'm feeling like a zero,Michael
31661,6,i mean a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea right,Jim
31662,6,i know i know,Michael
31663,6,we tried to find the fairest way to do it,Jim
31664,6,yes we did,Michael
31665,6,i just-- what,Jim
31666,6,um nothing i just i used to have to do this part alone and it was the worst i have something i would like to give you,Michael

31924,6,like a year,Pam
31925,6,i've been driving stick since high school so yes for a really long time that's all i had i just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend and a lot of people told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with but i think even then i knew that i was waiting for my wife so i would like to propose a toast so if you'd all raise your glasses not pam for obvious reasons but everyone else if you would raise your glasses--,Jim
31927,6,pam can't drink i didn't-- i shouldn't have said that i don't know why i did she can do whatever she wants though she shouldn't she shouldn't because she's an alcoholic pam is an alcoholic that's not true i-- no what we want-- the real reason is that that pam's pregnant,Jim
31928,6,ok ok hey what i think jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what these two people they're living together they're having lots of consentual sex--,Michael
31930,6,yes yes they were living together yes and you know what you can't expect them to be careful every time because frankly it's just a different sensation,Michael

31933,6,oh my god please,Jim

32522,6,he's alive so you're welcome,Andy
32523,6,not on the inside he's not look at his life broke living in fear no friends dead end job,Dwight
32524,6,yeah some of that existed before,Andy
32525,6,not the living in fear that's new,Dwight
32526,6,you're right that is new,Andy
32527,6,yes he's got to stand up to this mafia guy,Dwight
32528,6,well i don't see that happening,Andy
32529,6,me neither not the way things are now but what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy,Dwight
32530,6,are you saying-,Andy
32531,6,yeah,Dwight
32532,6,that we surgically remove the fear center from michael's brain,Andy
32533,6,what is wrong with you i am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia,Dwight
32534,6,that seems a little far-fetched,Andy
32535,6,well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown and that happened,Dwight
32536,6,michael incredible news grotti is clean,Dwight
32537,6,no he's not he's just good nothing sticks to him you still don't understand how this works,Michael
32538,6,no michael what we're trying to say is we made a mistake assuming he was mafia i have a buddy who's a fed and we did a background check on the guy his background is perfectly clean,Andy
32539,6,it's true he's clean i have a couple of friends still on the force checked with them ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take turns out he's a totally lovely guy sweetest guy on the force really,Dwight
32540,6,class act boy scout,Andy
32541,6,but grotti acts like he's mafia though,Michael
32542,6,he's trying to intimidate you to close sales he's just a pushy salesman,Andy
32543,6,and he made us all look like chumps,Dwight
32545,6,if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars bury them in my yard and i wouldn't tell the cops a thing not that i would be lying per se but i would just get really quiet all of a sudden,Michael
32547,6,this is scott,Michael
32549,6,oh really is that supposed to scare me,Michael
32551,6,well you thought wrong because i am not pleased i'm actually kind of po'd,Michael
32553,6,i think you know exactly why because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance,Michael
32555,6,i think you knew exactly what you were doing and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk,Michael
32556,6,whoa okay,Andy
32557,6,you suck,Michael
32558,6,okay that's-,Dwight
32559,6,and i'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance,Michael

32561,6,how about that the only person that actually needs insurance is you if you show your face around here again got it,Michael
32563,6,doubt it,Michael
32565,6,what a tool what,Michael
32566,6,next time you look in the mirror you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia,Andy
32567,6,no what do you mean,Michael
32568,6,we just told you he wasn't mafia so you wouldn't be scared,Dwight
32569,6,what,Michael
32570,6,you successfully backed down the mob,Dwight
32571,6,you made the mafia apologize to you you made the mafia be polite,Andy
32572,6,oh man i should be mad at you guys but i'm not,Michael
32573,6,so i looked him in the eye and i said 'not today grotti not today and not tomorrow and not the next day or the day after that and you can tell all your friends that if i see them then they're already dead' i said something like that,Michael
32574,6,very close,Dwight
32575,6,just to be clear he backed down an insurance agent from mutual of harrisburg,Oscar

33734,6,nice,Kevin

33826,6,there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue my little heart can barely take it no more today is the hardest i have worked in a long long time,Michael

33842,6,five years ago corporate said we had to start a recycling program for earth day so dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named recyclops,Jim
33843,6,happy earth day everyone i'm recyclops did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter,Dwight
33844,6,the next year he really stepped things up,Jim

33846,6,a year after that recylcops really began to take shape,Jim
33847,6,recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns,Dwight
33848,6,then tragedy struck recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing i can't remember,Jim
33849,6,recyclops will have his revenge,Dwight
33850,6,i think this was also the year he renounced earth day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved,Jim
33851,6,oh my god you guys look it's recyclops,Pam

33858,6,humans are terrible for the environment,Dwight
33859,6,the thing i like most about recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child,Pam
33860,6,mmm,Jim
33861,6,a world where you truly can be anything you want,Pam
33862,6,god bless you recyclops and your cold robot heart,Jim
33863,6,ok ok how 'bout this,Michael
33864,6,that's great,Pam
33865,6,i want it to be better than 'great' pam how 'bout i remain seated and i just do a little bit of a nod sort of a humble thing,Michael

34203,6,this encompasses all available data hours tardiness unconfirmed sick days participation everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency also this should be accompanied by a monetary prize,Dwight
34204,6,well in an ideal world,Jim

34240,6,jim said that,Kevin

34257,6,to my tally you just won back your own parking spot a vacation day and a nice tidy quarter of $1000 from all of us,Angela
34258,6,will everybody stop for a second because obviously i'm not taking any of it a mistake has been made and we'll figure it out second of all there was no cash prize,Jim

34262,6,no dwight i meant yes in a perfect world someone would get money but-,Jim
34265,6,all right wow um i am never going to forget today not a chance i don't think i could ever give back to you what you have given me today who here has done something stupid in their lives like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'a' gym and 'b' gym that sort of thing show of hands anybody yes a bunch of you okay well me too i've done something stupid which i would like to share ummm should we go,Michael
34267,6,ah all right i came here today because i promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable but you know what's invaluable is intuition you know what that is that is the ability to know when something is about to happen does anybody out there have intuition know what's gonna happen next nobody okay you're going to make me say it all right i am so proud of all of you derrick and lefevre and ben and ayana and mikela and nikki and jason and i'm sorry okay sorry spacing your name,Michael

34272,6,i lied to myself too i'm not a millionaire i thought i would be by the time i was 30 but i wasn't even close and then i thought maybe by the time i was 40 but by 40 i had less money than when i was 30 maybe by my 50s i don't know i wanted to pay for your education i really did it was my dream some people have evil drems some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams my dream was in the right place,Michael
34274,6,okay hold on hold on now i can't pay for your college but you don't have to go to class to be in class online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience and the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop which is rendered useless without batteries and i have one for each of you,Michael

34966,6,ok i feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever is christian slater back there because he knows he'd know what to do,Michael

34984,6,what if we just bring it up we just put it out in the open,Jim
34985,6,that's the weirdest possible solution to the problem,Pam
34987,6,all right,Jim

35159,6,jo i don't know how things work in florida which from your description sounds like a colorful lawless swamp but here it takes two men to do one job where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job,Michael

35402,6,i need a baby i'll never outsell jim and pam without one also i've been noticing a gaping hole in my life sometimes i wake up cradling a gourd,Dwight
35403,6,kevin you're such a gourmand,Pam
35404,6,i cooked my way through julia childs' cookbook and now i'm halfway through the twilight cookbook last night i had edward's corn flake chicken,Kevin
35405,6,hmm,Pam
35406,6,pregnant pam and i we get hungry at the same times so we've been eating together a lot not all meals just second breakfast lunch second lunch and first dinner,Kevin
35407,6,i thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner one last ultra feast,Kevin
35408,6,mmmm that sounds great what are you thinking,Pam
35409,6,i think it should be a surprise,Kevin
35411,6,no no i still have time,Pam
35412,6,i'm having contractions but they're irregular and far apart so i'm not really in labor i'm near labor,Pam
35413,6,yeah we're slow-playing it because of our stupid hmo,Jim
35414,6,if we check in after midnight i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors,Pam
35415,6,not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if it's crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it and i do not plan on helping unless it's a boy,Jim
35416,6,i cannot wait for that joke to be over,Pam
35417,6,ooh,Pam
35418,6,oh oh oh contraption she's contrapting okay you know what i think i should drive you guys to the hospital and here is why i am a licensed classy driver in the state of pennsylvania i gassed up the car,Michael

35423,6,you know the baby's not going to live here right,Pam
35424,6,well the baby was conceived here so might as well live here a little bit too,Michael
35425,6,hmm that logic's air-tight but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here burning man port-o-potty,Jim
35426,6,oh yuck tmi how was it i don't want to know tell me later let's go let's go hospital,Michael
35427,6,okay okay we're not going to the hospital we are waiting until midnight,Pam
35429,6,because the insurance company only covers two nights,Jim
35430,6,everything's fine we have plenty of time,Pam
35432,6,shut up nick what a weird thing to say weird it nerd don't get revenge on me nerd,Michael

35446,6,did you hear that butt-mud brooks,Pam
35447,6,okay but we are leaving at five minutes apart,Jim
35448,6,five minutes apart,Pam
35449,6,so the plan was seven minutes but we're calling an audible because that's her call because she's the quarterback i'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant,Jim
35450,6,okay stop watching me,Pam

35854,6,yes,Kevin
35855,6,why was i hiding behind the plant ha well in college i took a botony class and there was lots of drama in that class uh kids would gossip about me so i would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class and then uh they would say things like 'oh this guy's going to fail this class' or 'what's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants' and then i would jump out of them and confront them and be like 'oh you think all i do is hide behind plants and spy on people busted' oh the reason the reason i was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that i thought that erin and kevin were kind of hitting it off and i was jealous,Andy

37092,6,jim does a really good one do yours,Pam

37095,6,sorry gabe but that show hasn't been on in many cookies',Jim
37097,6,hey can i have your attention please first of all thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together and a very special shout-out to the chair of the party planning committee miss angela martin you have outdone yourself,Andy
37098,6,you know what i think we can all agree that angela's not so great so,Michael
37099,6,i am saying the exact opposite angela is fantastic,Andy
37100,6,no no no,Michael
37101,6,specific shout-out,Andy
37102,6,stop talking,Michael
37103,6,ok as some of you may know i have a very special connection with secretary's day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named erin hannon to a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations but to me she is my girlfriend in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations so i wrote a little ditty that i would like to play for all of you right now it's a little tune called secretary of love a one a two a one two three,Andy
37105,6,oh god,Michael
37106,6,can we talk about this in private,Andy
37108,6,yes,Andy
37110,6,no no never,Pam
37112,6,yeah pretty much,Dwight
37115,6,erin you know if i had been engaged to anyone before you i would've told you,Kevin
37117,6,so if you need anything i'm right over there,Kevin
37118,6,'hey erin you look delicious i mean beautiful',Pam
37120,6,what what do you mean suspend me,Pam
37121,6,i think you need to go a little easy you can't just suspend someone form work,Jim
37123,6,wait what i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making,Dwight
37125,6,c' is for suspension,Kevin
37126,6,why would that be something to talk about on secretary's day,Andy
37127,6,andy she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with all right and besides who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them that's like that's like mr and mrs smith crap,Michael
37128,6,i was going to tell her just on my own time,Andy
37129,6,you know what i resent the implication that i would keep that secret everyone here knows that i can't and won't keep a secret,Michael
37130,6,who cares i mean it's not like i killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it i probably should have told her i guess everybody does stupid things,Andy
37131,6,psst hey erin,Angela
37133,6,you embarrassed me earlier,Angela
37135,6,you think i want people remembering i had sensual relations with andy it's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled i want to throw up just thinking about it,Angela
37137,6,you are throwing up for the wrong reasons,Angela
37139,6,hey you know i was engaged before jim,Pam
37141,6,yeah and he worked here too,Pam
37143,6,no no it wasn't andy it wasn't it doesn't matter it's not about who you've been with it's about who you end up with sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants,Pam
37145,6,thank you,Pam
37147,6,hey toby,Pam
37149,6,very interesting,Pam
37151,6,thanks toby,Pam
37153,6,i don't think an apology is enough i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension,Pam
37154,6,and i got to take this bad attitude and i got to go home and i got to adjust it and i hope the suspension does that,Jim
37155,6,prideful idiots watch how it's done gabriel i apologize,Dwight
37157,6,i kneel before you,Dwight
37159,6,humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition,Dwight

37189,6,well yeah yes but i still feel sorry you know what i wouldn't worry about angela she doesn't hold a candle to you erin she's old enough to be your mom for one thing and she's like three feet tall and she wears pioneer women clothing and i don't think she's ever pooped in her life and andy you know come on andy his butt looks big in those khakis,Michael
37191,6,you said butt,Michael
37193,6,ahh you said it you know who you would love oh this guy in my neighborhood tom dizemore this is him: 'hey hey scott',Michael

37216,6,la telefona,Michael
37217,6,el telefono,Oscar
37218,6,michael's having a hard time with the gender part of spanish so i told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender and um i should have been more specific,Oscar
37219,6,your office is full of genitalia,Oscar
37220,6,oh eso es lo que dice el,Michael
37221,6,that's what he says',Oscar

37225,6,uhh,Angela
37226,6,all right so i'll finish up on bulk pricing and then you go into delivery guarantee,Jim
37227,6,you know maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there like um like 'i just delivered a baby they didn't offer me a guarantee',Pam
37228,6,yeah or maybe we don't even need that,Jim
37229,6,can you smell the power of the halperts power couple,Michael
37230,6,you know what i should be getting this client michael my numbers are better than either of theirs,Dwight
37231,6,i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company,Michael
37232,6,if you want people to put the best face on something why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives,Dwight
37233,6,that's a good point,Jim
37234,6,this is our first joint sales pitch i think we're gonna work really well together,Pam
37235,6,yeah i think we have complimentary strengths we understand each other,Jim
37236,6,we have good give and take i give he takes,Pam

37246,6,there's this woman i met a few weeks ago her name is donna the manager of sid & dexter's and right now we're in the midst of a passionate love affair um no but she is coming by today maybe to buy some printers so,Michael
37247,6,right here we have the wonder twins jim and pam halpert they will be assisting you today,Michael
37249,6,oh no we're actually married we're not brother and sister,Pam
37251,6,all right,Jim
37253,6,i knew it you should see their baby,Angela
37254,6,so yes laser printers are more expensive but they cost less to operate so it's a tradeoff,Jim
37255,6,hi,Michael
37256,6,hold on one second,Jim
37257,6,sorry to interrupt sorry to interrupt do you donna by any chance shop at victoria's secret,Michael
37258,6,what,Jim
37259,6,because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me,Michael
37260,6,none of this is time sensitive,Jim
37261,6,uh yes uh the sale is on now through may,Michael
37263,6,okay i have more of them,Michael
37266,6,what is this,Dwight
37268,6,it doesn't just sound a'ight it sounds amazing,Dwight
37270,6,how do i apply,Dwight
37272,6,uh glasses wearers cholera survivors geniuses non-organic family farmers the list goes on and on you want me to keep going,Dwight
37274,6,come here come here,Dwight
37276,6,ten seconds ago this guy was driving a forklift okay now all off a sudden he's cinderella of the office what are you guys thinking,Dwight
37279,6,one minority from this branch is going to get into this program who would i refer hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines,Dwight
37281,6,oh man white people right,Dwight
37283,6,well you can kinda tell from the voice,Dwight
37285,6,i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race,Dwight
37287,6,i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program,Dwight
37289,6,i know 'cause you have no role models how many indian ceo's can you think of,Dwight
37291,6,you could be the indian bill gates you could be the indian ted turner,Dwight
37293,6,that's not she's okay yes,Dwight
37294,6,i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and i want to show you there we go whoa look at those vivid colors look at my eyes those are shrek-green eyes that is me again i think this displays the crisp dazzling white,Michael
37296,6,and that would be a display of the crisp gorgeous black,Michael
37298,6,"it's subtle that's how it works i show her an image that turns her on 	and then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image soon she doesn't know what is me what is the image she just knows that she's turned on",Michael
37299,6,this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts i've never taken anybody there before,Michael
37301,6,ryan,Michael
37303,6,and that's it that's me that's who i am,Michael
37305,6,oh thanks you're not bad either,Michael
37307,6,hmm,Michael
37309,6,jim could you come in here for a sec what was that printer we were looking at,Michael
37310,6,you didn't see it pam she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move shortbread,Michael
37311,6,no,Jim
37312,6,i'll have one,Pam
37313,6,well maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work,Jim
37314,6,oh really jim what about pam and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pam,Michael
37315,6,okay well all that is irrelevant,Jim
37316,6,maybe michael has a point i mean if she was really that upset she wouldn't still be here,Pam
37318,6,look i know that i screwed up in there i know that i probably messed up your sale i just want to go in and fix it,Michael
37319,6,what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim,Pam
37320,6,what,Jim
37321,6,what was that,Jim
37322,6,just let him flirt with her people meet each other all sorts of ways,Pam
37323,6,pam you know he's not gonna get anywhere and he's gonna blow our sale,Jim
37324,6,who cares it's not that huge a sale,Pam
37325,6,hey the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale,Jim
37326,6,don't act like you understood anything that guy said good luck wingman,Pam
37327,6,how as being a minority affected you,Dwight
37329,6,oh good and you resent this because,Dwight
37331,6,oh no no that's not dorky look it's easily accessible boom like this 911 hello scranton strangler's in the house inside the house,Dwight
37334,6,look at that she's totally flirting with him,Kevin
37338,6,maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger,Pam
37339,6,like that,Kevin
37341,6,uh for that printer yes unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility,Jim
37343,6,yeah,Jim
37344,6,so maybe we could find a little wiggle room right,Michael
37345,6,what's that,Jim
37346,6,maybe wee find some wiggle room,Michael
37347,6,i don't i don't think so,Jim
37348,6,i think we could,Michael
37349,6,i don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money delivery alone will cost,Oscar
37350,6,okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right like for tax purposes,Michael
37351,6,actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money,Oscar
37352,6,why don't you run them again,Michael
37353,6,what if she's just flirting with you to get a better price,Jim

38490,7,to get some ice cream for everybody it's national ice cream afternoon great,Michael
38491,7,and another thing i did this summer i hired my nephew,Michael
38492,7,having luke here is a pretty big deal for me because his mother who also happens to be my half-sister kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14 the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95 so yes 15 years on the dot anyway i lost him in a forest,Michael
38493,7,don't bother luke,Michael
38494,7,why is there a circle with a line through it,Pam
38495,7,that means don't haven't you seen ghostbusters pam,Michael

38499,7,come on okay um that's as clear as i can make it,Michael
38501,7,because i don't want it getting back to sabre that we're yelling at assistants i think it would reflect poorly on us,Michael
38502,7,who's gonna tell on us gabe,Dwight
38504,7,nope it won't be gabe but actually there is somebody in the office that is very very close to luke,Michael

38507,7,yes of course,Dwight
38509,7,no no toby he's not yes he is he's my nephew,Michael
38511,7,luke is my nephew,Michael
38512,7,michael that's nepotism luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew,Oscar
38513,7,yes exactly that is a very nice way of putting it oscar mixing family and business is a beautiful thing,Michael
38515,7,do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson what if no one named hanson showed up that wouldn't even make sense or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer really safe,Michael
38516,7,oh man so many points being made,Jim
38518,7,god when he needed help on earth who did he hire jesus christ his son,Michael
38520,7,thank you,Michael
38521,7,but you're comparing you and luke to god and jesus,Jim
38522,7,no no i'm just saying why does god get to do something that i don't,Michael
38523,7,this is hypothetical we're talking about luke who happens to be terrible,Oscar
38524,7,well then why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad you just want me to fire luke that's reverse nepotism he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does,Michael
38526,7,if there's nothing wrong with this michael why have you been keeping it a secret,Oscar
38527,7,because i wanted you to come to me and say 'wow he is so great' and i was gonna say 'well it's in the genes' and i was actually gonna be wearing jeans and i'd point to them right no but you ruined it so thank you very much here he comes guys look i don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office i just want you to treat him like my nephew hey there he is,Michael
38529,7,whoo whoo whoo,Michael

38539,7,i came down here to feed the feral cats like i usually do and i found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car,Angela
38540,7,ok you know what just -just back off back off,Michael
38542,7,all right those might be his he might own an ebay store,Michael

38544,7,ok ok you know what this is disgusting this is like a witch hunt this is like the blair witch hunt project,Michael
38545,7,oh sure those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday,Oscar

38572,7,luke and i have been working side-by-side as master and commander me as master he as commander occasionally he will need a little push and i will do that and he'll slow down and i'll push him again that's the thing with kids you have to keep pushing you have to push them until they push you back and then you push some more it's all about give and take but mostly it's about pushing each other,Michael
38573,7,oh yeah this'll be easy so just like rearrange the buttons and stuff,Kevin

40134,7,when i was a freshman in college i worked at the student newspaper the cornell daily sun this was at cornell i had to write an op-ed column every day bernard's regards,Andy
40136,7,i started to ask myself 'do i have big plans here' i didn't want to become editor of that paper so i got up and walked right out of walter bernard hall and that's actually when i heard eight male voices singing unencumbered by instruments i was hooked so is becoming ceo of this company your a capella group come on we're going to danny's bar public school,Andy
40138,7,to be honest i still can't believe he didn't call her back who doesn't call a dork like that back,Jim
40139,7,oh wow,Pam
40140,7,spinach in a can power eat spinach,Jim
40141,7,aww my hero,Pam
40142,7,okay everyone i've tallied the votes and the winner of the costume celebration spectacular and the scranton wilkes-barre coupon book oscar martinez,Pam
40146,7,i know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately it's that time of year and according to a study done by the university of arizona they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat,Pam
40148,7,that's true that's true i dated her momma and you know what-,Michael
40149,7,stop,Jim
40150,7,um kay uh alright,Michael
40151,7,one of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough,Pam
40153,7,oh no it's just that if a vampire had to cough he would do it like this,Pam
40154,7,uh-huh right and ruin their cloaks do you have any idea how expensive wool is in transylvania 'cause of the euro,Dwight
40155,7,well other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly don't come in if you're sick,Pam
40156,7,uh,Dwight
40157,7,and get your flu shot also i'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office,Pam
40158,7,no no no they will cost you your life,Dwight
40159,7,elaborate,Jim
40160,7,the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it they need to fight their own battles if sabre really cared about our well-being they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt vomit fecal matter,Dwight
40161,7,i'm not - i'm not going to do that i'm not going to do that,Pam
40162,7,exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger,Dwight
40163,7,so by that rationale if i had to sneeze i should just sneeze on you,Jim
40164,7,yes i would welcome it,Dwight
40165,7,you're welcome,Jim
40166,7,the principle is sound to avoid illness expose yourself to germs enabling your immune system to develop antibodies i don't know why everyone doesn't do this maybe they have something against living forever,Dwight
40167,7,jim pam and the precious bundle of god's gift to everything i wish you both a pleasant day and you too yes praise god ok,Angela
40168,7,cece's getting christened today,Pam

41284,7,hey hey hey hey hey,Jim
41285,7,michael the reason i asked you down here for this chat is that i've been thinking that your fears about china are a bit exaggerated,Oscar
41286,7,did you know that china has a new missile that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast,Michael
41287,7,we have missiles too,Oscar
41288,7,did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal but what do i know i mean that's just according to the pentagon our pentagon,Michael
41290,7,what,Pam
41292,7,well thanks,Pam
41294,7,china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives and they will control us,Michael
41295,7,actually we're in a mild recession right now i'll give you that but people use china as the boogie man for all their problems in the nineteen eighties it was japan,Oscar
41296,7,how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17% and in the us it has only risen by 8%,Michael
41297,7,do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011 do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector i'd say that's far more relevant wouldn't you,Oscar
41298,7,don't i,Michael
41299,7,hello hello you're breaking the law,Pam
41300,7,impossible i love the law,Dwight
41301,7,read article nineteen there are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting it also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper,Pam

41315,7,yeah,Andy
41317,7,i am talking about freedom about choice america i don't think you need to worry because if you want to beat china you will if you don't that's fine that my friend is your victory y'know a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china and that may be the true but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation you get to a friend so here is to conversation,Michael

41696,7,it's so cold even with my coat on,Angela
41700,7,what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window you know what would have happened the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off and yes it might have been funny but it also would have been incredibly tragic,Michael
41701,7,i could not agree more and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress,Dwight
41702,7,what are you talking about you're the one terrorizing me,Jim
41703,7,with snowballs jim with fluffy little snowballs no i thought we were just playing,Dwight
41705,7,all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story you see this on my desk know who gave me this my girlfriend tara who lives in new york city,Michael
41706,7,wait what girlfriend,Dwight
41707,7,i haven't told you about her,Michael
41708,7,i find that unlikely you email me when you get a new zit,Dwight
41709,7,i'm a man in my mid-40s and i still get zits i think that's pretty interesting but you know what i am not on trial here the scranton strangler is so anyway we have this great weekend and she drives me to the airport and we get to jfk but i am flying out of laguardia so we laugh and laugh and laugh and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slo-mo drinking latte and at the end of the day she gives me this and she says 'michael maybe next time you should take a cab',Michael
41711,7,i do she is,Michael
41712,7,did you see her face well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g scott and it ain't tara,Michael
41714,7,yup,Pam
41716,7,no no jim had a great year actually i just wanted to get your opinion,Pam

41727,7,it is christmas,Michael
41728,7,no it really seems like something michael would do,Angela
41729,7,mmhmm mmhmm well the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me and that i have been framed,Michael
41730,7,why would anyone frame you for that,Andy
41731,7,okay i'm sorry why are we discounting this whole 'woody came to life' thing so quickly,Jim
41732,7,ahhhhhh surprise it was part of the party pretty funny huh,Michael

41741,7,okay hey hey hey,Dwight
41742,7,no fake girlfriends are always wrong,Jim
41744,7,when you got transferred and i drove you up to nashua you said 'michael i love you but i can't do this' but then with this other guy you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship do you and you know what that is what is the matter with me,Michael
41746,7,and we did this whole stupid party for you,Michael

43191,7,erin what are you doing,Michael
43193,7,that's that's well don't put words in my mouth,Michael
43194,7,threat level: midnight is the great lost film of michael scott,Jim
43195,7,we're all in it from like years and years ago it's like a home movie,Pam
43196,7,yeah if michael scott did your home movie,Jim
43197,7,michael screened a work in progress for us years ago and it didn't go well we thought it was a comedy everything pointed to it being a comedy,Pam
43198,7,we'd love to see it,Pam
43199,7,sweet i will go invite holly,Michael
43200,7,okay everyone i know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in but we have to remember that michael is sensitive so let's stay positive and no laughing no comments just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day okay,Pam
43203,7,mhmm it's got action it's got heart it's got some bosom,Michael
43205,7,it's got a lot of me,Michael
43207,7,ladies and gentleman threat level: midnight,Michael
43208,7,i play samuel michael scarn's robot butler i wanted samuel's voice- to be like this but michael thought that samuel should be a very advance android almost indistinguishable from a real person,Dwight
43209,7,dwight does not play a robot,Michael
43211,7,i did not love the dialogue or the character i took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless,Jim
43212,7,he cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned what was the point of spilling the drink on me,Dwight
43214,7,by far and away the most expensive shot in the movie but it was integral to the story,Michael
43215,7,that was not scripted,Michael
43217,7,sorry,Jim
43219,7,i'm sorry i'm really really sorry i think i was just relieved to see that michael scarn got his confidence back,Jim
43221,7,it's like one of the best movies i've ever seen in my life,Kevin
43223,7,or carnivals,Kevin
43224,7,well that's a pretty good reaction pretty cool right did you like it did you like that,Michael
43226,7,okay no it's not good enough it's not good enough,Michael
43227,7,some people are really popping on screen,Andy
43228,7,hey,Michael
43230,7,mmmm good everybody out there says it's great,Michael
43232,7,did you what did you love about it,Michael
43234,7,no no holly this isn't ocean's eleven where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out what'd you really think honestly,Michael
43236,7,is it is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me see because i need you to keep me grounded,Michael
43238,7,it was eleven years okay this has been my dream for eleven years and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream,Michael
43240,7,i talk about a lot of things holly i was eventually gonna get around to my dream obviously eleven years i could've been working on the scarn nebulus,Michael
43242,7,because if i don't have this what do i have i have nothing,Michael
43244,7,i have my book on business somehow i manage i have my hbo comedy special here i go again dot-dot-dot but you know what when i think about it when i really think about it none of those things are as real to me as my movie,Michael
43246,7,yeah you're a real pain in the ass and i'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great and i'm sorry i called you a pain in the ass i'm angry and i love you,Michael
43248,7,i am a huge woody allen fan although i've only seen antz but i'll tell you something what i respect about that man is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life he stayed true to his films or at least the film that i saw which again was antz the thing is i thought bug's life was better much better than ants the point is don't listen to your critics listen to your fans,Michael
43249,7,who likes threat level: midnight okay then who wants to watch the rest,Michael
43250,7,we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game trying to qualify for states,Michael
43251,7,that's fine it's great,Jim
43252,7,no no actually it's really screwed up because they they were trying to qualify they were disqualified they had to forfeit the game undefeated season that's why there were so many people there,Michael

43711,7,yes thank you,Michael
43712,7,so about this proposal thing,Pam
43713,7,no no no no my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it,Michael
43714,7,michael she's perfect for you,Pam
43715,7,she's the one,Oscar
43716,7,she's amazing this is very exciting,Jim
43717,7,so we just we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable,Pam
43718,7,i had a great idea until you ruined it,Michael
43719,7,wanna know how to do it here's how you do it take her out to dinner go down on one knee if you are in costume you did something wrong if at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar stop and look at yourself,Oscar
43720,7,hmm i'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card,Andy
43721,7,nice,Kevin
43722,7,and call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all,Andy
43723,7,no you cant do that you cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn,Kevin
43724,7,why not seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being,Andy
43726,7,oooh,Andy
43728,7,no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life,Kevin
43730,7,well played,Andy
43732,7,we must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot,Andy
43733,7,no but that's not fair,Kevin
43734,7,well that's dallas,Andy
43736,7,what ryan where did you get this picture,Oscar
43745,7,ok i think animals and proposals are out right ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out,Pam
43747,7,how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof it hits the ground the head pops off this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you',Michael
43748,7,that's a guarantee,Jim
43749,7,it's easy enough to get a corpse you just go to a med school i already have the ring,Michael
43750,7,don't think you need the corpse then,Jim
43751,7,heres the ring,Michael
43752,7,holy s*** is that real,Pam
43753,7,yeah i saved 3 years salary,Michael
43754,7,no,Oscar
43755,7,is she not going to like that,Michael
43756,7,no she's going to love it so i think you can keep the proposal simple you know like when jim proposed he just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect,Pam
43757,7,where was that,Oscar
43758,7,at a gas station,Jim
43759,7,at a gas station,Michael
43760,7,oh it was when she was working in new york so it was halfway between both of us,Jim

43762,7,no it was really it was really sweet it was raining and,Pam
43763,7,oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect i want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever,Michael
43764,7,totally reasonable,Jim
43765,7,i just it's terrifying,Michael
43766,7,she's not gonna say no,Pam
43767,7,i know but i'm still scared i don't know why,Michael
43768,7,cause it's a big deal i mean i knew pam was gonna say yes but i was still scared,Jim
43769,7,you were scared,Pam
43770,7,yeah its scary,Jim
43771,7,get this kevin thought i was gonna sell my bowflex for 200 dollars and i told him 'dude this was a prop in my movie',Michael
43773,7,ok it's because we haven't sold anything you know what we just wait until the end of the day people get desperate and they're gonna pay anything,Michael

44970,7,nope baskets have it,Jim
44971,7,so as it turns out unless you're a young child or a prison inmate you don't need anyone supervising you people just come in and do their work on their schedule imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper unsupervised and yet somehow it works it must be because the stakes are so high,Jim

45235,7,really,Jim
45237,7,what is it,Jim
45244,7,you could just be saying it to get the job,Jim
45246,7,how about this why don't you give us a part of the plan and that way we know you have it,Jim
45248,7,okay,Jim
45250,7,did you just trademark that,Jim
45253,7,we are the search committee hand-picked by our ceo and tasked to find this branch's new manager not everyone we meet will be good but someone's bound to be right and to be honest i think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house so i'm not too worried but i'm really excited to spend a lot of time with toby and gabe did you know that gabe's last name was lewis i had no idea,Jim
45263,7,the manager job nah i'm barely interested i just can't not go for it you know it's not the bernard way we give it the old college try and then in defeat we show grace,Andy

45267,7,eeehhh no hehe,Andy
45268,7,in my family you don't really go out and get things if you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on wednesdays and fridays so i don't know i guess you could say this job is on my list and we'll see what rosa comes back with,Andy
45278,7,should you really be so blatant about that,Pam
45279,7,they won't make me manager and i won't settle for anything less i've gone about as far as i can here that's obvious time to take my talents elsewhere,Dwight

46491,8,so darryl says to me 'fire me' but what he really means is 'i'm gonna say something really weird try and figure out what it means' so i say 'no you're not fired' but what i really mean is 'i have no idea what your talking about but i'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better'i really hope that's what he and i mean,Andy

46525,8,and it's clear we're not going to carry them,Dwight

47263,8,the accountability booster it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office from a late delivery to an accounting error five strikes in a day equals a home run one home run and you're out,Dwight
47264,8,if we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block minesweeper,Andy
47265,8,or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown and as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him,Dwight
47267,8,robert's favorite songs: creep by tlc creep by radio head you remember that one jim there is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper oscar he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him kelly,Dwight
47269,8,ps we should should kill him,Dwight
47270,8,wait so you installed a doomsday device,Jim
47271,8,no it's an accountability booster,Dwight
47272,8,which when it goes off it destroys everything very similar to a doomsday device,Jim
47273,8,jim you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other i am confident that you guys are equal to the task,Dwight
47276,8,smile- nod smile and nod,Dwight
47277,8,they are making me out to be a bond villian i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world like- not doctor moreau someone good doctor frankenstein doctor jekyll not them doctor-,Dwight
47278,8,are you sure this is a good idea i mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes,Andy
47279,8,but the device will change that without a safety net people will improve,Dwight
47280,8,alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work be extra careful double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha,Andy
47282,8,there's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham we just make a mistake i'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment,Oscar
47283,8,oh there's one mistake,Dwight
47285,8,dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so i-,Andy

47595,8,in this case yes,Oscar
47596,8,no there are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman,Dwight

47633,8,and i'm telling you i don't,Jim
47634,8,you don't find cathy attractive,Pam
47635,8,no i don't,Jim
47636,8,no i'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that i find her replacement objectively attractive just like i'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun it's true but it doesn't help anybody,Jim
47637,8,look at her even i want some fries with that shake,Pam
47638,8,okay uh i don't so are we good,Jim

47641,8,her breasts are large her waist is small her reproductive health in ample evidence and facial symmetry- come on,Dwight
47642,8,the thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently like you're a kid almost they lose all sense of boundaries they start acting weird telling you things that clearly aren't true i know it sounds nuts but i think dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth,Pam
47643,8,dwight am i hot right now,Pam
47644,8,why would i or anyone else think that you're hot right now i can't impregnate you and that's the driving force between male-female attraction,Dwight
47645,8,what about before was i attractive before,Pam
47646,8,meh you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time gradual recovery and uh well now obviously you're at an all-time low,Dwight
47647,8,hmm i think jim's lying to me about not being attracted to cathy,Pam
47648,8,you think jim's lying that's so cute i know he's lying,Dwight
47649,8,five bucks if you can get him to admit it,Pam

47653,8,okay,Pam
47654,8,rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth,Dwight
47655,8,i think so okay,Pam
47656,8,rule two: we stop at nothing,Dwight
47657,8,well what does that is that okay,Pam
47658,8,rule three: don't fall in love,Dwight
47659,8,yep good,Pam
47660,8,we're gonna bust this guy,Dwight
47661,8,honesty is very important to me,Pam

48005,8,hunger hunger for victory hunger for honor hunger for pride,Andy
48009,8,exactly now do you know the civil war soldiers were hungry for pride now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives colonel harrison jeffords of the fourth michigan infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died he wasn't about to let them have that flag pride right guys i commissioned this flag for dunder mifflin cost me two hundred dollars,Andy
48010,8,only two hundred dollars,Jim
48011,8,we are all branches on this tree and from the tree comes paper we're all part of a business but business is war what's that i hear uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag wha- what's going on here wee-hoo come and get it who's gonna get the flag who's getting it whoa hey ho don't look where i am look where i'm going juke right juke left,Andy

48025,8,really,Dwight
48026,8,yeah,Oscar
48027,8,well anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms,Dwight
48029,8,you've heard about it,Oscar
48030,8,yes ha prepare to be refuted go on,Dwight
48034,8,hallowed ground,Dwight

48039,8,you're right there should be a monument to this,Oscar
48040,8,never trust a cookie with a woman's name pecan sandy lorna doone madeline they'll just break your heart,Kevin
48043,8,what no,Kevin
48046,8,no this is not fair this is my idea he's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me,Kevin
48048,8,every time you buy a big mac you set one ingredient aside then at the end of the week you have a free big mac and you love it even more because you made it with your own hands,Kevin
48051,8,dammit,Andy
48053,8,you guys came where's everyone else,Andy
48055,8,yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there i guess he follows orders,Andy
48056,8,yeah sorry everyone else didn't come i think they're just tired with holes in their shoes and they have dysentery,Jim
48057,8,even without an audience you're still at it,Andy
48058,8,what are you talking about,Jim
48059,8,our office has a disease and it goes by many names sarcasm snark wisecracks you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes that's what you did with this trip,Andy
48060,8,andy this whole idea of our situation being just like war it's just not true we just work at a paper company and you're our regional manager and guess what man you don't have to prove anything we like you as regional manager andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head i'm wearing a very pink hat i've been getting weird looks all day because i'm pretty sure 'dm does gb' means something kinda sexual but guess who's wearing them all of us just for you man that's huge,Jim
48061,8,you don't like the hats,Andy
48062,8,they're terrible,Jim
48064,8,they just didn't turn out how i wanted in my head they were cooler but they do look weird,Andy
48065,8,the world will little note nor long remember the fight jim and i had here at gettysburg and that's good because i was basically wrong i wanted my team to be like this army and i was their general but i guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and i'm their manager yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that i think about it,Andy
48068,8,i can do that,Kevin
48070,8,your arm feels good on my back,Kevin
48071,8,for some reason my boss is obsessed with cookies it's not my specialty my specialty is pizza but i'm flexible,Kevin
48072,8,charge,Andy
48075,8,it's kind of a haul so we should probably get going and tuna i made a special sandwich for you guess which kind,Andy
48076,8,tuna,Jim

51616,8,oh well i feel that as someone who knows pam only a little bit enough a good amount not the most though i would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with,Jim

56224,9,well they can't all be winners but trevor's next and he's a real professional you say 'jump' and he says 'oh who' he loves to jump on people that trevor,Dwight
56225,9,what makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman,Dwight
56227,9,well it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman,Dwight
56229,9,all right do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter,Dwight
56231,9,there were only two options,Dwight
56233,9,this is a bus transfer,Dwight
56236,9,sure yeah go ahead,Jim
56238,9,yeah absolutely do people like sitting next to you you're clean right,Jim

56250,9,i knew it i knew it,Jim
56252,9,i looked at you coming around and i said 'wintergreen',Jim
56253,9,i can't hire clark yeah he looks like a schrute but he thinks like a halpert and he acts like a beesly,Dwight
56254,9,okay here's one a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock you can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party,Dwight
56256,9,thank you,Dwight

56266,9,it does but still no,Dwight
56268,9,oh you think they're my only friends i've got way more friends than that and they're all better than the losers who work here,Dwight
56270,9,just - i don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances,Oscar
56271,9,well of course not but does physical appearance include smell,Pam
56274,9,meredith i tell you all the time,Kevin
56276,9,next up my cousin mose mose could make a great paper salesman he's got a natural fear of paper which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible i've got big expectations mose-wise,Dwight
56277,9,what quality would make you a good sales associate,Dwight
56279,9,it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical,Dwight
56281,9,you know we live together right,Dwight
56283,9,and i've never seen you go to work ever,Dwight
56285,9,so why is this on your resume,Dwight
56297,9,when i was young i spent several years at a private school where i was told i would be taught to harness my mutant abilities turned out it was a conman copying charles xavier's school for gifted youngsters from the x-men comic books took me years to figure out that it was a con some people never figured it out,Dwight
56299,9,i don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years someone say something,Angela
56302,9,how is it my fault,Jim
56304,9,but it's dwight who's bring in all the weirdos,Jim
56305,9,yeah but jim dwight's a weirdo we can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos we can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos,Oscar
56306,9,hey i'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when jim's away i'm in a position where i'm rooting for nate and that just feels wrong forget it i need to work on my mural i have some pointy trees that i need to round off,Pam
56308,9,yeah this is actually about the new sales guy uh dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos and i was wondering if i could have some input-,Jim
56309,9,this is dwight schrute who am i speaking to and don't lie i can tell if you're lying,Dwight
56311,9,david,Dwight
56313,9,really that's interesting 'cause i was thinking that since jim is only here part time he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day and frankly killing it lately,Dwight
56314,9,i was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk near my wife-,Jim
56316,9,oh um-,Jim
56318,9,okay i can't say that that's not fair,Jim
56319,9,sounds fair to me david,Dwight
56321,9,oh yeah so we'll just do that later,Jim
56322,9,no why not do it now,Dwight
56324,9,uh well it's about athlead i'm sorry does dwight have to be on this part of the phone call,Jim
56325,9,i'd love to be in the loop david,Dwight
56327,9,there's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor -,Jim
56329,9,yes okay bye,Jim
56330,9,i'd love to invest,Dwight
56331,9,no thanks,Jim
56332,9,i'd like to give you $100 million,Dwight

56336,9,yeah,Pam
56339,9,dwight you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend,Jim
56340,9,i'm not these people are the best of the best i find talent an attractive quality in a friend,Dwight
56342,9,you know who else was a freak spider-man and he was also a hero,Dwight
56345,9,mandatory paintball uh wolf please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch,Dwight

56357,9,okay good good good,Dwight
56359,9,this isn't gonna work out,Dwight
56361,9,nate is a proven entity but not without his handicaps; hearing vision basic cognition trevor is great but i saw no fire in him today and this is a guy who loves to start fires troy is literally one of a kind he's a goblin or a hobbit or a kobold which is a type of gremlin and yet i'm hesitant why can't i pull the trigger on any of them,Dwight
56362,9,no no no i just need to tell them i just need to tell them,Dwight
56364,9,i do that myself now,Dwight
56366,9,no you've been towed by now they tow after about 45 minutes,Dwight

56377,9,just act natural,Dwight
56378,9,and i was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife,Dwight
56379,9,but you know i wouldn't hire any of these all-stars,Jim
56380,9,aah god that sucks aah what are you gonna do i mean it's your call,Dwight
56381,9,nope your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought not even gabor,Jim

56402,9,oh that sounds awesome can we wait till i get off work,Dwight

59695,9,listen um i was scared you know i loved what i had and i didn't want to risk it and i think that maybe i did doubt him a little too which was wrong because he's shown me time and again but when the documentary started airing people on the street told me that i had this fairy-tale romance but there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale but then it got deeper and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale it's like a long book that you never want to end and you're fine with that because you just never ever wanna leave it,Pam

59848,9,thank you david,Oscar
59849,9,uh could i please have your attention so a year ago i got my first art commission to paint a mural for dunder mifflin and i decided to paint the history of paper which was just some trees and stuff and then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and i had to start from the beginning but it all worked out for the best because i think that i've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us all of us and this is for you jim and go ahead,Pam
59850,9,everyone let's take our picture in front of the mural oh um i just- i kind of meant just everybody from the office,Pam

59857,9,yes,Kevin
59858,9,dunder mifflin this is pam oh i'm sorry jim halpert doesn't work here anymore,Pam
59859,9,i didn't watch the whole documentary after a few episodes it was too painful i kept wanting to scream at pam it took me so long to do so many important things it's just hard to accept that i spent so many years being less happy than i could have been jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him it'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes not that i'm a tragic person i'm really happy now but- it would just- just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself 'be strong trust yourself love yourself conquer your fears just go after what you want and act fast because life just isn't that long',Pam
59860,9,if there is one thing that i have learned through this whole experience it's that if you film anybody long enough they're going to do something stupid it's only human natural,Kevin
59861,9,hey guys,Dwight
59862,9,hi,Angela
59864,9,what about the honeymoon,Pam

59880,9,there it is,Jim
59881,9,do i get along with my co-workers well first of all i don't have co-workers anymore i have subordinates so- have i gotten along with my subordinates let's see my supplier relations rep meredith palmer is the only person i know who knows how to properly head bang to motorhead oscar martinez my accountant is now godfather to my son angela schrute my former accountant is now my wife my top salesman jim halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator pamela beesley halpert is my best friend so- yes i'd say i have gotten along with my subordinates,Dwight
59882,9,you might feel sorry for me but i actually feel sorry for you because you're about to leave cornell so say it with me: : oh i can so just sit here and cry,Andy
59883,9,oh yes,Kevin
59885,9,thanks dad- darryl,Andy
59886,9,i spent so much of my time here at dunder mifflin thinking about my old pals my college a cappella group the weird thing is now i'm exactly where i wanna be i got my dream job at cornell and i'm still just thinking about my old pals only now they're the ones i made here i wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them someone should write a song about that,Andy
59887,9,you take something ordinary like a piece of paper it's not much but if you see it in the right way-and that's what you did with this documentary but seriously you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami,Oscar
59890,9,imagine going back and watching a tape of your life you could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up you could watch yourself fall in love watch yourself become a husband become a father you guys gave that to me and that's an amazing gift,Jim
59892,9,thanks phyl,Jim
59894,9,do you even have a mattress,Angela
59896,9,oscar oscar i think i'm gay,Kevin
59897,9,why do you say that,Oscar
59898,9,it's just that i'm so emotional,Kevin
59899,9,yeah but you're not gay you're not gay,Oscar
59900,9,no but maybe the reason-,Kevin
59901,9,you're not gay,Oscar
59908,9,i sold paper at this company for 12 years my job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper even if i didn't love every minute of it everything i have i owe to this job this stupid-wonderful-boring-amazing job,Jim
59909,9,i thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary but all in all i think an ordinary paper company like dunder mifflin was a great subject for a documentary there's a lot of beauty in ordinary things isn't that kind of the point,Pam
