"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 8",Michael,how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine same comedic timing and people file a complaint to corporate is it because i'm white and chris is black

"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 10",Michael,kevin is a great guy he's a great accountant he is not much of an entertainer
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 11",Kevin,basically there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people every time the one type wants to have a good time then the other type comes in and makes a real mess
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 11",Michael,ok i'm sorry i'm sorry he's ruin he's butchering it could you just let me every time every time black people want to have a good time some ignant ass i take care of my kid they always want credit for something they supposed to do what you want a cookie
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 12",Dwight,excuse me i'm sorry but that's not all it takes to be a hero a hero kills people people that wish him harm a hero is part-human and part-supernatural a hero is born out of a childhood trauma or out of a disaster that must be avenged we all have a hero in our heart
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 12",Michael,i don't think i can sign this well ok it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already so i know i could sign something that says that i taught something or that i helped you teach something so pam where is she pam could we change something on this sure
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 13",Michael,here's the thing this office i think this is very advanced in terms of racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to that's probably throwing you off a little bit ok well i know you told me that several times ok well here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training and you don't i won't yeah yeah
"Season 1, Episode 2, Scene 14",Michael,i regret my actions i regret offending my coworkers i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty empathy respect and open-mindedness' open-mindedness is that even a word 'into the workplace in this way i can truly be a hero signed daffy duck' he's going to lose it when he reads that

"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 1",Dwight,michael i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing i but if there were i'd be protected as assistant regional manager yeah so i don't have to worry bottom line do i need to be worried
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 1",Michael,oh god dwight come on there's no downsizing assistant to the regional manager dwight look look look i talked to corporate about protecting the sales staff and they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing okay but there's no downsizing so just don't mmm mm mm maybe
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 2",Michael,it looks like there's gonna be downsizing and it's part of my job but blah i hate it i think the main difference between me and donald trump is that uh i get no pleasure out of saying the words 'you're fired' 'you're foir-ed uh you're foir-ed' it just makes people sad and an office can't function that way no way 'you're foir-ed' i think if i had a catchphrase it would be 'you're hired and you can work here as long as you want' but that's unrealistic so
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 3",Dwight,it's a real shame 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos which puts me at a disadvantage because i bring my own water to work
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 4",Dwight,i didn't do it what do you mean oh the water cooler was brought over here for maintenance so what do you guys hear what's the scuttlebutt
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 5",Michael,get set for operation morale improvement starring michael scott now i think i have had a little stroke of genius in that i have had my assistant pam smile pam i have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up so we can have a little celebration for it not bad not bad at all all right and the birthday person is drum roll please here we go who is the birthday birthday person who is it who's the birthday next person on the calendar yes all right come on down meredith um uh ok well great well you know it'll be a surprise yeah why not sure go ahead live a little come on pam come on shake it up shake it up shake it up brrrp uh spock are there any signs of life down there well let me check captain eeee eeee eeee eeee no captain no signs of life down here just a wet blanket named pam brr-rrrp star trek

"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 6",Angela,what no yeah i think that's a good idea what color do you guys think i think green is kind of whoreish
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 6",Pam,how about green
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 7",Pam,this was tough i suggested we flip a coin but angela said she doesn't like to gamble of course by saying that she was gambling that i wouldn't smack her
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 8",Michael,these are my party-planning beeyatches pulled off an amazing '80s party last year off the hook so i was thinking if you haven't already got a cake um maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from baskin-robbins those are very good very delicious she's not the only one that's going to be eating it right i think everybody likes ice-cream cake it's not uh it's not just about her so mint chocolate chip that'd be good how about some mint chocolate chip
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 8",Angela,meredith's allergic to dairy so
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 8",Pam,it is her birthday
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 9",Dwight,hey so listen i was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and i formed an alliance 'cause of the downsizing i think an alliance might be a good idea you know help each other out do you want to form an alliance with me good good excellent ok now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 9",Jim,absolutely i do

"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 13",Dwight,there's one other thing and this is important let's keep this alliance totally a secret don't tell anyone
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 14",Pam,an alliance what does that even mean
"Season 1, Episode 4, Scene 14",Jim,oh yeah i think it has something to do with survivor but i'm not sure um i know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort underground

"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 58",Michael,tmi too much information i used to say 'don't go there' but that is so lame now or 'you go girl' or um when did 'where's the beef' that was like a long long time ago it's funny how the shelf life of these things like how long they last like 'too much information' probably came on the scene i mean i didn't hear it till like this month so it's pretty recently um but you know they're generally good for like no more than five or six years
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 61",Angela,yes i'm the designated driver which is very important we need everyone to get home safely but no one ever gives me gas money and people live all over it's expensive

"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 63",Jim,mmm-hmmm he plays guitar he likes naval history he's a bowler well you seem to have this under control
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 64",Jim,the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational i mean he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year which is probably why this branch will be downsized
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 65",Michael,i am the fat accountant here he is really what did they say 'for a good time call michael scott' why do you think that you just immediately go to that dwight why are you so negative why i mean you just come in and you're just negative and you just walk negatively do you want me to find out what it says yes what does that even mean what are you what are you talking about just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me but don't tell anybody that i have anything to do with it because if they ask me i will say that you are crazy thank you you won't regret this michael i hadn't planned on including him kevin
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 65",Dwight,michael i need to talk to you i just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall uh no no no i think something bad maybe michael michael by any means necessary it's the ladies' room
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 65",Jim,good one what award would you like to give dwight okay
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 66",Dwight,it hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower when i was in school the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm so i really identify with those women from enron i wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me but they never wrote back i guess they're all married
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 67",Dwight,angela it's simple just tell me what the bathroom wall says i'm not asking what you do in there i just want to know what's written about michael okay i'll talk you nod if i get it right does it have to do with his butt or his wiener
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 67",Angela,i don't talk about what goes on in the restroom i don't says those kinds of things out loud it's inappropriate
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 68",Kevin,i think his characters are pretty funny especially ping
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 69",Michael,well what should i do guys seriously do you want me to just cancel the dundies ping everybody loves ping he's my most popular character really well he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have who talks exactly like that so i think you should take it up with him instead of me well neither of you are chinese so what why do you care
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 69",Oscar,i think many people find that character slightly racist look i'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 70",Dwight,no no no it's not what you think i'm on official business this is dunder mifflin no phyllis you're not phyllis no no phyllis no no do not listen to her she's out of her mind that is not true that's totally unfair i was just in the ladies' room in order to spy what do you think phyllis you think i followed you in there like 'oh good phyllis is going to the bathroom so maybe i get to see her naked from the waist down' i'm not even attracted to you
"Season 2, Episode 1, Scene 70",Michael,what dwight you've hit a new low here that is a good point okay all right i will do that i will get to that definitely absolutely oh i don't know maybe after i finish writing producing directing and hosting your awards show all right just relax keep your pants on unless of course you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without creepsville central spying on you good

"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 21",Dwight,cumberland mills and how did you get my resume oh no no i'm very flattered don't get me wrong i'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online what does it say under martial arts training oh okay i'm gonna have to supplement that could i have your fax number
"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 22",Dwight,would i ever leave this company look i'm all about loyalty in fact i feel like part of what i'm getting paid for here is my loyalty but if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly i'm going wherever they value loyalty the most
"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 23",Oscar,oh hey oh
"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 24",Dwight,so you got the fax so why didn't you add it to the res what do you mean of course martial arts training is relevant oh excuse me i know about a billion asians that would beg to differ uh yeah i get a little frustrated when i'm dealing with incompetence well you know what you can go to hell too and i will see you there burning fine okay oh wait so you'll let me know when you've made a decis

"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 28",Jim,honestly i don't think michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire i think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer uh or be run over by a bus before the deadline but in the end really what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall and therein lies the true essence of his charisma um yes
"Season 2, Episode 5, Scene 28",Michael,can i speak to you a minute

"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 30",Dwight,and in conclusion i think that lex luthor said it best when he said 'dad you have no idea what i'm capable of' smallville and that is why i feel that i deserve this raise
"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 30",Michael,that's from superman
"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 31",Pam,do you think michael and jan actually how do you come back from that no i mean doing that with michael how do you come back from that as a human being

"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 32",Michael,wait wait wait wait come i just i just wanna know why ok so you're saying that there is a different time or place well ok well never as in 'never ever ever' or never as in there's still a chance i just want to know from the horse's mouth what is the dealio am i too short really i appreciate that thank you no i wasn't i didn't cry- so my looks have nothing to do with it
"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 33",Michael,jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now and it doesn't matter how great a guy i am and that is all i needed; i'm good i can go home now
"Season 2, Episode 8, Scene 34",Michael,hey it's 12:20; where the hell's dwight never missed a day my ass

"Season 2, Episode 9, Scene 49",Jim,and in this room here if you look closely you will find out a few clues about who lives here um he likes biking obviously and uh what else uh he likes tour guides i guess and if you're very perceptive you'll notice that he didn't do a great job of cleaning his room ok and uh that's the tou- um thank you ryan uh i don't know i think i made the mistake one day of telling someone that i like penguins and here we are and that's why it's on my desk phyllis; it means a lot to me and now that i know it was from you it means even more moving on uh ok so that's the end of the tour for now and if you liked it please tell your friends: 'whenever you're in scranton visit casa de la halpert'

"Season 2, Episode 10, Scene 30",Michael,reverse psychology is an awesome tool i don't know if you guys know about it but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid works like a charm
"Season 2, Episode 10, Scene 31",Michael,'in addition to these paintball pellets your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute' who wants to take paintball lessons how is that better than an ipod
"Season 2, Episode 10, Scene 31",Dwight,you and me michael yes i never said it was better than an ipod

"Season 2, Episode 10, Scene 41",JIm,okay
"Season 2, Episode 10, Scene 42",Jim,to think that my gift for pam will be used for that it's a little too much to handle

"Season 2, Episode 11, Scene 8",Michael,leader ship the word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership' as its derivation so if this office is in fact a ship as its leader i am the captain but we're all in the same boat teamwork
"Season 2, Episode 11, Scene 9",Oscar,last year michael's theme was 'bowl over the competition' so guess where we went

"Season 2, Episode 11, Scene 36",Michael,i'm in the brig see the boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised what was the deal with the guy jumping overboard what was if he had just waited and heard what i had to say he would be motivated right now and not all wet
"Season 2, Episode 11, Scene 37",Michael,is somebody there captain jack has a problem with authority he just totally lost it if you ask me he caused the panic well it's nice for you your friend got engaged roy said the first one didn't count really you're kidding me you and pam wow i would have never have put you two together you really hid it well god i usually have a radar for stuff like that you know i made out with jan yeah yep well pam is cute well if you like her so much don't give up bfd engaged ain't married never ever ever give up

"Season 2, Episode 17, Scene 8",Dwight,what if i give a really long extended thank you for instance 'thank you mr blank thank you very very very'

"Season 2, Episode 17, Scene 9",Dwight,when i was in the sixth grade i was a finalist in our school spelling bee it was me against raj patel and i misspelled in front of the entire school the word 'failure'
"Season 2, Episode 17, Scene 10",Dwight,i can't do this oh okay okay deal i'll do whatever you say no questions asked i'll try and think of one when is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice
"Season 2, Episode 17, Scene 10",Michael,that's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how because you have no skills dwight there's no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time but i can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company well if you have a question you should ask me don't don't try and think of a question to humor me just try not to be such an idiot insult
"Season 2, Episode 17, Scene 11",Pam,mom i'm sorry i know you and dad are chipping in for the wedding but i do not want orange invitations yes well if you really want my

"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 11",Michael,a mediator's tool chest okay well before we get started you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style no okay this is important the first style is lose/lose just hold on please okay if we do lose/lose neither of you gets what you want do you understand you you would both lose now i need to ask you do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win the important difference here is with win/win/win we all win me too i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 11",Angela,can we go i have a lot of work to do can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 11",Oscar,what's the next one
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 12",Michael,okay since this is the disputed poster now one at a time i want you to express your feelings using 'i' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements come on seriously that okay okay stop stop stop let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win yes thank you pam how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt which oscar wears that way he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar she can see it win/win/win okay well brainstorm own the solution okay that is called a compromise and it is style 3 and it is not ideal to sum up win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt win/lose - take the poster down compromise - tuesdays and thursdays and the answer is make the poster into a t-shirt win/win it is done
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 12",Angela,i got this poster for christmas and i feel i want to see it everyday it makes me feel like the babies are the true artists and god has a really cute sense of humor that's no how about i leave it up but it
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 12",Oscar,i don't like looking at it it's creepy and in bad taste and it's just offensive to me it makes me think of the horrible frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it it's kitsch it's the opposite of art it destroys art it destroys souls this is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno i'm talking about the no how 'bout she takes it down fine
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 12",Pam,win how about angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays win win
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 14",Pam,hey angela i didn't have your zip code

"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 65",Michael,there is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby and they can't decide so they bring the baby to a wise man just like a manager in those days and the wise man says 'i will adopt this baby and raise it as a hindu' see they didn't expect that and that fixed it because i think he was the dad anyway
"Season 2, Episode 21, Scene 66",Michael,there are dozens of old complaints in here cold cases like the show and toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve well you know what i have a problem with that and i'm going to open up these cases before toby can kill or rape another person

"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 5",Michael,it wasn't just an action movie it was die hard exactly yeah i know ok a little too far crossed the line
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 6",Michael,i would have never called him that if i knew you don't you don't call retarded people 'retards' it's bad taste you call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded and i consider oscar a friend

"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 17",Dwight,of course absolutely not well he's not dressed in women's clothes so you could assume everyone is and not say anything offensive
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 18",Michael,hey what about angela she's hard and severe she could be a gay woman i don't know i can imagine her with another woman can't you

"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 38",Michael,did you know that gay used to mean happy when i was growing up it meant lame and now it means a man who makes love to other men
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 39",Michael,we're all homos homosapiens gays aren't necessarily who you think they are people i mean anybody could be gay business-men like antique dealers or hairdressers or accountants oscar why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out to everybody here however you want to do it go ahead stand up i'm doing this for you
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 39",Oscar,yes i'm gay and i didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today so whatever can i sit down now
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 41",Michael,who should be the judges and juries of our society yes that's a good point she has a good point because gay marriage currently is not legal under us law i bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them so they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could you know sounds pretty good right
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 41",Angela,judges and juries
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 41",Kevin,: that sounds great

"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 43",Oscar,you sound pretty defensive michael i think the problem with this office is that
"Season 3, Episode 1, Scene 44",Michael,look if i was gay i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen i would be leading the parade covered in feathers and just i would be waving that rainbow flag you misunderstand-- ok you know what ok i uh i'm gonna put my money where my mouth is you ready i am going to embrace oscar you might want to watch this angela because you can't catch anything here we go we are going to make a statement you and i are going to make a statement together oscar is my friend --- and i just don't care who sees it doesn't bother me

"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 27",Dwight,i'm sorry i grew up on a farm we slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon my grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum it would have fit if he had given me another minute
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 28",Dwight,i need a box i need a box a small box not too confining yeah oh thank you yes please excellent always
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 28",Pam,is it for the bird i have it covered if you wanna do something for the funeral maybe you could play a song on your recorder do you have it with you
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 29",Pam,did i wake up this morning thinking i'd be throwing together a bird funeral you never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 30",Jim,where'd i find what
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 31",Jim,i called the manufacturer who referred me to distributor who referred me to the vending machine company who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 32",Michael,glad you could all make it dwight do you have the box you made this wow that's that's very nice
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 32",Pam,actually i have it
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 34",Pam,i'd also like to say a few words if that's okay what do we know about this bird you might think 'not much it's just a bird' but we do know some things we know it was a local bird maybe it's that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above and we know how he died flying into the glass doors but you know what i don't think he was being stupid i think he just really really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song an impression then lastly we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died but of course we all know that doesn't mean he was alone because i'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much he will not be forgotten just smile for me and let the day begin you are the sunshine that lights my heart within on the wings of love
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 34",Michael,yes shhh
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 34",Kevin,oh i remember that that was so funny
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 34",Dwight,he's not a songbird
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 34",Angela,amen
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 35",Michael,society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong well that's baloney because grief isn't wrong there is such a thing as good grief just ask charlie brown
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 36",Dwight,let's get back to work
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 37",Jim,umm sure he's so cute that's okay oh no it's not i'm sorry is that your husband in the tub with him sounds good
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 38",Michael,oh wow he does his family know but i'm the first in the office okay yes sure i will do that cause i'm the first to to find out nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them well good how are you holding up want me to come over
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 39",Michael,ed truck died and it blows they say that with grief time makes it worse which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so i've had more time to be sad
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 40",Dwight,attention everyone as you know ed truck is dead if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook remove it now also if you have any photographs pam will make her shredder available during lunch that is all
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 41",Dwight,remembering the dead doesn't help anybody the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again in this case some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body i'm working on both
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 42",Michael,i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor we need to find out what is blocking you and that way we'll be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored may he rest in peace what was that kevin no you said something didn't you you think that's funny you are disgusting no that can't be right well then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world doesn't it
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 42",Kevin,ces nothing may he rest in pieces you know because there's like two pieces of him no
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 42",Dwight,michael no need to call corporate we are supposed to use toby he's trained as a grief counselor
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 43",Pam,hi well i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone i've never met closer to the epicenter i guess
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 44",Kevin,not really
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 44",Michael,you're ruining it already they should not be given the choice
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 46",Kevin,no
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 46",Michael,wow wow no no you are the most heartless soulless person i've ever met no no shh enough it is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here dwight ryan i want you to take the table out we're gonna go on a five minute break and when you come back we're going to start with a clean slate and in the interim i would like you to forget everything that toby has said okay
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 47",Michael,i don't think i'm overstating it when i say that toby is a plague on this company and he is worthless you give people a chance to shine and they blow it just like you knew they would grief counseling is not about 'are you hungry would you like a sandwich' these people are so far gone you have to stick a food tube down their throats
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 48",Michael,okay part of the problem was that toby talked at you now i am going to talk with you first off i want you to be comfortable because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up so guys loosen your ties just take your jackets off if you want ladies let your hair down you know what even take your shoes off i wanna get personal and i want you all to really open up and i want you to know that anything and everything can be said
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 48",Angela,okay i don't think kevin should take his shoes off
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 49",Kevin,my feet do not smell angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 50",Michael,i found an exercise in toby's binder that he managed to miss that involves screening the part of you that says 'i don't wanna do that i don't wanna talk about that that is too private' here's how it works i'm going to throw you this ball
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 52",Pam,really wow i thought that was supposed to be like next month yeah i'd love to see them oh and tell them i say 'congratulations' i should probably head back in but umm thanks for the break
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 54",Pam,michael once told me that home alone is the saddest movie ever when i asked him why he said 'because the whole family forgets the kid at home there is nothing funny about that'
"Season 3, Episode 4, Scene 55",Michael,that's hold it hold it hold it start like right in there just dig okay give it to me you don't know what you're doing all right nothing let's just all right guys do you have a box we could use

"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 25",Michael,well i am taking responsibility it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car i'm not superstitious but i'm i am a little-stitious

"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 28",Michael,kelly you are hindu so you believe in buddha are you sure what are you ok 1 sikh and
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 29",Dwight,as a farmer i know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery with the electricity we're using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days you tell me what's unethical
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 30",Dwight,blink once if you want me to pull the plug are you a doctor or a male nurse pfft her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did or at least she got time off for one just doing my job
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 31",Michael,you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you and then you run over one person with your car and it's not even one of the popular ones and everybody gets on your case doesn't make any sense god is dead maybe believing in god was the mistake what did people believe in before the sun maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice too like a giant buffalo or some sort of monster like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat or just the head of a monkey with the antlers of a reindeer with ah the body of a porcupine
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 31",Jim,i will do some research
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 31",Pam,i can help you with that
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 32",Dwight,so just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine mm-hmm no no you've gotta be bitten by something actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital cause the only way to beat rabies is to start treatment before the symptoms set in lock jaw
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 32",Michael,oh god rabies i was in the hospital room with her how contagious is that is that like an std this place is so cursed i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her with my car but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis thanks to me she went to the hospital and i saved her life curse is broken curse is broken people oh there is a god and he has a plan for us after all so go home get some rest very very good work today we got a lot accomplished
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 32",Jim,six of one really
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 33",Michael,is there a god if not what are all the churches for and who is jesus' dad

"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 36",Michael,a woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies but that is where we are in america and that does not sit right with me and that is why i'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies a disease that has largely been eradicated in the us but not very many people know that
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 37",Michael,hi stanley how many sponsors so far come on man gotta step it up it's for a good cause jan called this morning and pledged $50000 that is for a good cause phyllis how's the rabies quilt coming oh look at that 3 way to honor meredith phyllis yes ok alright alright shhh i know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts ok well back in olden times a large fat person like this was a person of power a person who had money could buy food person of respect like the regional manager of the day whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was someone who worked in the fields and i was a peasant well you're going to have to run or you're going to be in a lot of trouble it is not olden times anymore
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 37",Andy,isn't that your money
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 37",Kevin,michael you cannot make me run it is not a real charity it's stupid michael and i'm not gonna do it you didn't run for me when i thought i had skin cancer no i just don't want to run i didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 38",Andy,i'm petrified of nipple chafing once it starts it is a vicious circle if you have sensitive nipples they chafe so they become more sensitive so they chafe more so i take precautions
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 39",Andy,hey angela hey um i'm sorry about your cat
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 40",Angela,this is sprinkles she was my best friend i kept her going through countless ailments i asked dwight schrute to feed her once and she is now deceased this is halloween last year just a couple of kittens out on the town
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 41",Angela,pssst i'm having relationship problems and since you're always having relationship problems i thought you'd be able to give me some advice i have this crazy thought that i know is crazy that maybe dwight killed my cat when i got home sprinkles' body was in the freezer where dwight said he left her but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds something's not right the vet's doing an autopsy did roy ever kill one of your cats
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 41",Pam,what's wrong hmm ah angela i'm sorry i'm more of a dog person
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 42",Jim,so what's your strategy for this race mm-hmm what why won't more people do that what
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 42",Pam,well i'm gonna start fast then i'm gonna run fast in the middle then i'm gonna end fast cause they're just stupid
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 43",Jim,oh ah no that's not i mean that wasn't ah i mean i can see how it would seem a bit like we uh how it looks like um i mean now a days you can edit anything right i mean you can edit anything to look like um anything right wow there it is it is going really great
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 43",Pam,yeah that was um yeah i gave him a ride home because we're dating ah yeah we haven't told anybody but it's going really great right
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 44",Dwight,oww you're taking this out on me but i was only the messenger you'll feel better after the 5k exercise is good for depression
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 44",Angela,shut up oh really i'm not depressed i'm in grief
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 45",Michael,we have raised almost $70000 most of it from me and jan um when do they put that on the giant check or is that something that we write in later hmm that's a tough decision um i always imagined it with a giant check so yep you didn't contribute very much i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor and how's that been going what about a rabies nurse that's possible look into that have you met that kid he's not going to college
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 45",Pam,well a giant check costs about $20000 to make up i have a print shop standing by but what do you think michael that's over 25% of our funds giant check it is not well a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $70000 or $50000 if we go with the giant check and also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor i don't think so
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 45",Jim,yeah i mean i personally am definitely on board for the giant check yeah bat birth control which we are you know what though i've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour for parties and bachelor events great it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah oh actually more with tips
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 45",Dwight,well i don't know on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control wait this money is going to bat birth control right michael that's what you told me when i contributed maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for meredith's son
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 46",Pam,michael 5k means 5 kilometers not 5 thousand miles hey oh my god you said come in oh my god
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 46",Michael,come in hey hey hey what are you doing no i didn't just please don't
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 47",Pam,so i closed the door but the image of his dangling participle still burned in my eyes come in yes or come in on average how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office just ballpark they're so not i didn't see where it started but i saw where it ended
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 47",Jim,baquette eww i can imagine you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room gross alright
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 47",Michael,may i enter the room see how i did that that's the way you should enter a room you knock and then you wait for the all clear yes but i have an office so why would i do that european offices are naked all the time besides my shirt tail covered most of it so that's not gross it is the human body what is your problem pam you're an artist right think of me as one of your models ok you know what i don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today it's not fair to people with rabies and that's the point right ok let's go have some fun
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 48",Pam,they say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked i do not recommend this strategy try picturing them with more clothes on or a funny coat
"Season 4, Episode 1, Scene 49",Jim,oh i'm sorry is this a working office and not a french beach

"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 70",Michael,ryan is causing some problems and you were always good at handling him what should i do to control him i know i know no what something else uh-huh good
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 71",Michael,my generation's all about hard work and accomplishment like the moon landing or vietnam rolling stones greatest band ever and still rockin' oscar one of the greatest all-time oldies was a little oriental guy named confucius he literally invented the ancient chinese secret here's some of his quotes confucius say 'man who farts in church must sit in his own pew' confucius say 'man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day' confucius also say 'virgin like balloon one prick all gone' no i skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page which proves that he was old but he was also hilarious
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 71",Oscar,you're forty-three mick jagger's like sixty-five did you google confucius and just print out the first thing you saw
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 72",Michael,i'm not it's solitaire see

"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 75",Pam,michael doesn't know how to work his blackberry so when he says blackberry me a message he means write it on a post-it note and stick it to his blackberry
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 77",Jim,you didn't set up your blackberry dwight as opposed to what about cars they do so cars are flightless airplanes got it they're like the penguins of the airplane family thanks
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 77",Dwight,yes i did but i do not intend to use it it is pointless technology printing press tractor mechanical thresher telephone airplane the only inventions that matter they fall under the category of airplanes correct that's an excellent analogy vaccines are for chumps
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 77",Pam,hey dwight what about vaccines
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 78",Dwight,my mom didn't believe in vaccines i got my smallpox the old-fashioned way and i survived so joke's on you hospitals
"Season 4, Episode 2, Scene 79",Michael,the one advantage to being older is that i know a few things about a few things and i am young enough to not forget them and old enough to know the difference between the two i am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws but young enough to date college girls but old enough to know better i'm at a perfect age i could die now but i won't because i am young

"Season 4, Episode 3, Scene 2",Jim,there's this cube on the screen and it bounces around all day and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away and we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room okay i believe she thinks she saw it
"Season 4, Episode 3, Scene 3",Pam,i saw it i saw it and it was amazing who said i didn't see it did jim say that i didn't see it i saw it

"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 5",Kevin,mama bear
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 6",Jim,i think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us i mean when i tell people that i work at dunder mifflin they think that we sell mufflers or muffins or mittens or and frankly all of those sound better than paper so i let it slide
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 7",Jim,you playing that game again oh it has losers
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 7",Dwight,second life is not a game it is a multi-user virtual environment it doesn't have points or scores it doesn't have winners or losers
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 8",Dwight,i signed up for second life about a year ago back then my life was so great that i literally wanted a second one in my second life i was also a paper salesman and i was also named dwight absolutely everything was the same except i could fly
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 9",Michael,little girl in a field holding a flower we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison but we zoom back further--- actually i don't get paid by the hour anymore but thank you i get paid by the year so yeah i know mmm okay that's what nassau came up with that sucks whoa well we can do better than that the waving
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 10",Andy,i need some advice i've been spending a lot of time making out with angela lately but we've been necking but only necking right not actually kissing our mouths just the neck on neck it's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together it's hot i'm not going to lie to you but it's a little weird but you seem like a guy with answers so how do i fast track this to get to first base we'll use code names that's not different enough
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 10",Dwight,we cannot talk about this because someone might hear us angela can stay the same but we'll change andy to dwight dwike
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 11",Michael,shrek shrek i'm a donkey i'm a donkey shrek i'm just kidding it's me hello ry okay calm down i have a small problem yeah well when i call about big problems you don't like that either so make up you mind kiddo here is the deal the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box and sort of ignoring my ideas i'm creative ryan well actually i can't cook and i am starting a restaurant mike's cereal shack i'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store yeah are you i don't think you're doing such a good job here suppressing ideas and creativity
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 12",Michael,all right let me ask you this tell me if you think this is creative when i was five i imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn and this is before i had even heard of one or seen one i just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows and had a huge spike in its head and i was five five years old couldn't even talk yet
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 13",Michael,hey guys um you know what we cannot shoot this ad today how about never hundred hours sir hey thanks thank you
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 14",Michael,yeah i'm glad you called ryan is being a little bitch again what's up my brotha listen david i would like to do this ad in house i want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office and i will send it to you tomorrow morning take a look at it and if you do not think that it's ready to air send the ad agency back down here and we'll do it on my dime i'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it okay and thus michael scott sealed his own destiny in a good way
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 15",Michael,has anyone ever come up to you and said 'you're not creative' well they're wrong you are creative you are damn creative each and every one of you you are so much more creative than all of the other dry boring morons that you work with

"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 45",Dwight,we had already applauded
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 45",Pam,how about darryl
"Season 4, Episode 5, Scene 46",Jim,michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative which i think is odd because michael actually might be the most creative person i've ever known every day michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 5",Michael,this is perfect this is a dummy a la ferris bueller's day off we have tied a string to the wrist which goes to the door when somebody opens the door the hand goes down hits the remote turns on the tape recorder which is me snoring now nobody knows whether i am here or whether i am gone but you will not tell anyone well sometimes most of the time i will be with ryan or darryl yes oh good good stanley first victim this is what i want you to do go out come back in we're going to hide i want you to tell me if this looks like me okay just go out and come back in what

"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 6",Jim,oh i don't think that is what's happening
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 7",Michael,you cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary the bluesy wisdom the sassy remarks the crossword puzzles the smile those big watery red eyes i don't know how george bush did it when colin powell left and if utica thinks that they are going to poach stanley they have another thing coming
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 8",Michael,how can i get you to stay yeah we all want money but there is none in the budget so tell me why you're really leaving mo money mo problems stanley you of all people should know that let me ask you this if i were- pssh kay

"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 10",Pam,oscar toby and i are founding members of the finer things club we meet once a month to discuss books and art celebrate culture in a very civilized way sometimes the debate can get heated but we're always respectful there is no paper no plastic and no work talk allowed it's very exclusive
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 11",Oscar,besides having sex with men i would say that the finer things club is the gayest thing about me
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 12",Jim,so tell me again why i can't be part of your club oscar
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 12",Pam,because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny some people
"Season 4, Episode 6, Scene 13",Michael,fillipellers how's it hanging to the left to the right okay enough small talk go ahead yes listen um you cannot tear stanley from his family like this no his work family look this is very hard for me but i'm going to give you my best man you may have toby you can train him he's very very smart and funny and charming you know i can't do it toby is the worst that- that was a bluff um listen if you are going to poach one of my guys i'm going to poach one of yours okay good-bye wait wait karen could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please your best one

"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 12",Michael,when jan and i had satellite we used to watch a reality show called 'survivorman' and it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die try not to get eaten by an animal or be overexposed

"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 15",Michael,dwight and i are going out he will return later but i will not i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow and perhaps the next day no dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness where he will then leave me to either die or to survive the choice is yours yes and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days do not try to follow me this is a very personal private experience in the wild that i wish to share it with me myself and i when i return i hope to be a completely changed human being

"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 16",Dwight,do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment let's put it this way: no i do not
"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 17",Michael,this is what a true survivor man does you simulate a disaster like a plane wreck you could only wear the clothes that you have on and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets now in this case this disaster is a serial killer creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead well yes i would and i would survive well you you you are as creepy as a real serial killer for real ok i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings now this way i can't retrace my steps i don't know what streets we've been--- ow what are you doing no gosh dwight stop it stop it stop it just please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life
"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 17",Dwight,no i would never leave you for dead you would never escape i would make sure that you were dead first i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified and they would call me the overkill killer what are you doing it would be better if you were unconscious do you want to do this right or not

"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 20",Michael,look at those wrinkles blacks do crack not crack the drug
"Season 4, Episode 7, Scene 21",Jim,and the other is something inappropriate or horrible or both what else he only sings the high harmony to 'happy birthday' and he's a very big believer in surprise parties maybe even arguably possibly to a fault

"Season 4, Episode 9, Scene 31",Dwight,michael's dinner party is for couples only which is why i wasn't initially invited but that was then i very recently entered into a serious monogamous relationship if that idiot ever gets here
"Season 4, Episode 9, Scene 32",Pam,where did you grow up
"Season 4, Episode 9, Scene 33",Michael,it's been a rough couple of weeks little trouble yes well jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift yes so she's passed out and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog and the neighbors blamed jan it's like you know the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place anyway it's a tragedy really because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds so well
"Season 4, Episode 9, Scene 33",Pam,wow you did neighborhood watch
"Season 4, Episode 9, Scene 34",Jim,what's that
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 1",Pam,wb jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get which just means we get to see more of our lovely street tell them what we saw today jim nature

"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 4",Pam,some of us like the walk more than others
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 4",Kevin,hurts like hell
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 5",Pam,did you pick a new chair it's been awhile but instead you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 5",Michael,pam when i first opened this catalog i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 6",Pam,michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago and normally i wouldn't care but he promised me his old one it's way better it's one of these i really want it
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 7",Michael,have you ever seen this woman hmm look at her smile those eyes look at her eyes she's got - i don't know what it is actually she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch oh yeah maybe but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman jan i think that fate put this catalog in my hands
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 7",Pam,her the one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair or in a great chair i definitely remember your dinner party actually i put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 8",Michael,what is it like being single i like it i like starting each day with a sense of possibility and i'm optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 9",Michael,ladies and gentleman would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 9",Pam,no he hasn't picked one yet

"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 14",Michael,oh hello oscar mayer weiner lover i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em because of your condition umm what oh hmm i see feisty so she's not jolly or sassy not like a jolly sassy opera singer oooo catcher or in field is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer could we share a row boat could could a row boat support her i think i'm being very clear what i'm asking would an average size row boat support her without capsizing it bothers me that you're not answering the question damn it i knew it i knew it phyllis ok
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 15",Michael,what is wrong with these people i would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry
"Season 4, Episode 10, Scene 16",Michael,dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me but it is and you know why because nobody here is willing to help me nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request would it well fine here goes well now ok i know that this is probably not appropriate but i need help because i want to play ball with my kids before i get too old and before that happens i need to get laid and before that happens i need to be in love and i don't wanna hear 'ahnnn i can't help elhh la la' no no i'm a catch and i am not going to be the one who got away so this is what we're going to do dwight is going to hand out index cards and i want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day no by the end of the hour or you are fired

"Season 4, Episode 12, Scene 27",Michael,i don't understand why you keep picking on me you just do and i don't know why so please help me understand well stanley maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well all right you don't respect me i accept that but listen to me you can't talk to me that way in this office you just can't i am your boss can't allow it

"Season 4, Episode 14, Scene 9",Angela,we have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of toby but so far we only have two pictures of him michael no you know-no you always do this we have a nice modest party planned and then you come in and demand the world let me be clear there is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides although toby won't be in them
"Season 4, Episode 14, Scene 9",Pam,do you mean leaves as in dies you want us to throw toby a new orleans' funeral
"Season 4, Episode 14, Scene 10",Michael,every year my sweet sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars and lately she has been sending me like nine or ten checks a year uh as nana starts to but i knew i should be saving it for something i just didn't know what i should be saving it for and then i had an awakening 'michael buy a motorcycle' so i put the money in my shoe and then i forgot about it until now
"Season 4, Episode 14, Scene 11",Michael,i want a party that makes me feel like i am flying through the air without this ugly weight holding me down you know i want an antigravity machine i saw it in a movie you drink a potion and then you just start floating all around phyllis can you do this

"Season 5, Episode 2, Scene 15",Jim,19 minutes and 48 seconds what were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds so i guess i can assume that was personal so maybe you're not completely ethical after all

"Season 5, Episode 9, Scene 1",Oscar,here are our final actual costs for this year as you can see we did pretty well so alright well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis right there you can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300 but we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand so you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar and now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars so you have an extra dollar so you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy but guess what next summer and you ask them for money they're gonna give you nine dollars 'cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand so what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand we have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget we should spend this money on a new copier which we desperately need
"Season 5, Episode 9, Scene 1",Michael,mmm okay yes yes i can see that we did indeed why don't you explain this to me like i am an eight-year old yes there's the x-axicks mmhmm okay why don't you explain this to me like i'm five ho-oh yeah i'll be six so the dollar's a surplus this is a surplus whoo okay break it down in terms of um okay i-i think i'm getting you

"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 3",Dwight,a lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time shampoo i just want to say for the record i did not kill anyone stanley was attacked by his own heart and he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days yes i shouted 'fire' i shouted many things i also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded-- when no one hedded-- n-no one would take hedded of my instructions so you-- and well i don't see my co-workers-- hee-heeding this right now no peta
"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 3",Michael,electricity hed hedded take hedded of heed heed take heed of take heed of okay this city dwight we are not mad we are just disappointed yes we are we are livid but we are going to let this one slide i am not a mind reader david and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice something that dwight doesn't like do you you talking to me what
"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 4",Dwight,well i guess we papered over that pretty nicely it always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise what's the matter you hungry don't you worry about that i got it covered okay i am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping what you come on that's preposterous
"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 4",Michael,no dwight i am worried a man's life is in my hands yeah that's not gonna happen i'm taking over as safety man yes i'm a smart guy i'll figure it out no i will
"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 5",Michael,nobody should have to go to work thinking 'oh this is the place that i might die today' that's what a hospital is for an office is for not dying an office is a place to live life to the fullest to the max to an office is a place where dreams come true

"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 13",Michael,we found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his when his heart went berserk and i knew exactly what to do but in a much more real sense i had no idea what to do so i thought we should have cpr training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it red cross you know racket

"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 42",Michael,ok everybody i've figured it out the reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think you are keeping these feelings inside and that is what's causing stress so what is the solution solution is honesty laughter and comedy in short what no no i am talking about a roast of michael scott oh c'mon who here has the comedy central roast channel you've seen it right everybody gets together and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy and everybody's laughing and everybody's hugging each other si senor it's not it's not offensive during a roast anything goes i want you guys to really get crackin on this i want you to take me down don't hold back i want you to really make fun of anything about me it could be my race could be the fact that i'm so fit or i'm a womanizer fair game whatever i don't want to write your stuff for you but i just want it to be good

"Season 5, Episode 13, Scene 59",Dwight,it's very unusual for michael not to show up to work my guess he's either deeply depressed or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain he has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them and i always say michael take two steps back and stare at the icicle from the side and he's like no i like the way they look from standing directly underneath them

"Season 5, Episode 17, Scene 17",Pam,i don't think jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her shush kevin a playful touch on the arm or on the back it can show your interest and it's really romantic
"Season 5, Episode 17, Scene 17",Andy,don't touch her don't talk to her don't look at her

"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 22",Andy,duuudes stop stop doing that
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 23",Pam,and then out of that cake pops another stripper holding a smaller cake and then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one cupcake it's cupcakes and strippers all the way down
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 23",Michael,what is that smaller stripper holding ok
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 25",Michael,party planning committee not your concern charles really well then how would we come up with great ideas like jim's go ahead it's a great idea and we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay but it's cool and it's- whoa you're talking about my anniversary party so yeah why don't you do that yeah here we go ok what newsflash: i've been here for fifteen years headline: you have been here one day end of story you have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party end of story end of story end of story ok no no no no no you know what i'm going to new york and i am going to talk to david wallace i'm going to tell him everything and i'm sorry to say you're screwed and you know what you are gonna be through and i'm sorry i'm sorry to do that to you do you even know how paper is made it's not like steel you don't put it into a furnace if you put paper into a furnace you know what would happen you'd ruin it
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 25",Jim,no i would like to get back to work actually please you pet the animals and they pet you back
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 25",Pam,it's really just a regular shaped cake
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 26",Jim,hey alright charles i've gotta be honest i think we really got off on the wrong foot here and truth be told i'm a pretty smart guy and uh a hard-worker and a great number two for the office second-in-command to michael oh that's because at first it was a made up position for dwight just to make him feel better assistant to the regional manager but then he lost that and michael gave it to me assistant regional manager yeah no not exactly alright i will um i'm just gonna let you get back to that yep
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 27",Michael,hello stephanie ok where is he
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 28",Michael,so is this the meeting you've been in all day i drove
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 29",Michael,cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party just pulled the rug out from under me and he said no figs i've already bought em and i don't have a place to store them so i feel like i've been sort of boned do you talk to him about this you've talked to him all day obviously did you talk to him about this ok then i don't get it it doesn't make any sense to me because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles and then charles was supposed to talk to you and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again clearly that's what you wanted fifteen years i have been here and i have sacrificed a lot i've put having a family on hold and i've never gone hang-gliding and i've never driven my car to the top of mount washington
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 30",Andy,cool

"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 35",Michael,i don't understand that after fifteen years of service here i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you that doesn't seem right to me that doesn't seem fair and i think that i've earned more than that ok i quit you have no idea how high i can fly
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 36",Andy,i'm telling you when corporate sends somebody it is big trouble or really good news and then sometimes it means business as usual why are you asking him i just told you why he's here
"Season 5, Episode 18, Scene 36",Oscar,well it's- dunder mifflin
"Season 5, Episode 19, Scene 1",Michael,i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit i got on that ramp and i thought two hours two hours to go feeling good listen to some tunes should've peed before i left okay so i get up to the building i get to the revolving door broken so i have to take the normal door no no i was so nervous it was the wrong building i walked into the wrong building

"Season 5, Episode 24, Scene 15",Dwight,we're in crisis mode here do you understand the two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together and frankly i'm not convinced that michael and pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone no you're too close stanley how do you feel about those two taking your clients he doesn't like it her face is okay but-- jesus what --what are you doing here get out we need to do something i'm thinking maybe a coup or we take ryan hostage no i'm not saying we do those things i'm saying something like those things excellent question words will never be enough no pictures are too interpretive oh well that--that's a great idea jim oh i totally see your point okay we'll talk to michael directly so uh meeting is over i guess i'll see everyone upstairs c'mon guys psst listen now is the time for action i'm talking action--
"Season 5, Episode 24, Scene 15",Jim,can i address that okay of course what is like a hostage strongly-painted picture can i just say something i know that tempers are high but i think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to michael directly great see you upstairs

"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 17",Michael,how do you un-tell something you can't you can't put words back in your mouth what you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue including 'stanley is having an affair' it's like the end of spartacus i've seen that movie half a dozen times and i still don't know who the real spartacus is and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 18",Michael,yeah anorexia she's an anorexatic nothing can be done we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best i guess

"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 21",Andy,did you hear the rumor about me that i'm gay and do you think it's true do you think that i'm gay no but let me kick you a scenario i'm at a beach cabana and brad pitt approaches he tries to lean in and kiss me i would definitely resist like at first but if he was persistent i think i might give in a little bit just to see what it felt like would i push him away how hard like what if he's like really aggressive it's not real brad pitt this is like this is my fantasy or it's like not a fantasy it's just it's just a scenario
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 21",Oscar,i did yes what are you attracted to other men if you resisted brad pitt a little bit he would still need to get to you wow i wish i wish i could help you i don't you might be gay you might be gay what exactly is my responsibility here to comfort insecure heterosexual men that can't possibly fall to me

"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 27",Andy,even the fact that i'm gay yes michael am i gay
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 27",Angela,no we heard that about jim how is that a bad rumor i knew it

"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 27",Kevin,i knew it her breasts were a tiny bit bigger at first i thought 'oh she has a new bra with padding' but then i thought 'pam doesn't need padding' it just didn't add up jim
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 27",Dwight,who's the father
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 27",Pam,jim stop don't just yes okay
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 28",Pam,it's clear why we were trying not to tell people that's clear now

"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 29",Jim,michael we only told our parents last week i did it was inconclusive don't take it you can't do this that sounds terrible
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 29",Pam,you're right we should've realized that you are an equal part of this you called stanley's wife if you talk to her you're gonna tell her about stanley and that's gonna seem more suspicious michael please don't
"Season 6, Episode 1, Scene 30",Michael,well it turns out that teri was already suspicious because she had caught stanley and cynthia a few months ago so stanley promised that he would stop and he did end of story well not exactly uhh cynthia kept calling him she would not stop calling him and she was in love with him oh and get this cynthia also married so you can't stop love i guess and quite frankly i don't think you should ever try

"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 7",Oscar,look it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders go ahead name a country that doesn't have two presidents a boat that sets sail without two captains where would catholicism be without the popes
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 8",Jim,i have noticed that we-- thank you i've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings and i'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit um-- yes okay maybe we should talk specifics okay yesterday we had a meeting about planets i am right yes i agree i just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day you mean on a weekend how about this i think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential really you just agreed to that
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 8",Michael,welcome mm-hmm disruptive no i don't think they are i think the meetings are very important let's do n-- well to be fair jim james jimothy to be fair jimothy the-- ah that sounds weird are you okay with being called jim alright jim to be fair the conversation wasn't about planets at first we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon so you draw a line from there to the other planets and i think by the end we all learned a little bit about how small we are because it's a big universe and we're all just little tiny specks of dust you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps you go to sleep it's light out you wake up it's dark that's the whole day where did that day go i have no idea yes alright no more meetings this week i can be very suprising
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 9",Pam,i need to fit into my wedding dress however i'm also pregnant we did but mostly because people expect us to we're also accepting other gifts not on the registry however much
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 10",Pam,it's awkward asking people for money but we could really use it why doesn't crate & barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 11",Pam,oh good no we're not
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 12",Michael,mm-hmm yeah just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks got one of each stanley you don't need to answer that what do you mean by 'these people' oh hey everybody i think that jim has gone insane because he thinks that my office is a conference room listen jim no offense but when push comes to shove what i want is more important that what you want what do you guys think no no no you don't need to go anywhere anything that jim has to say to me he can say in front of these types of people that is not what wallace told us that is not the way i heard it
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 12",Jim,okay i thought i saw people missing really hey stanley what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door stanley okay michael i thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these michael this is a conference room meeting that's not what i meant i disagree great guys can i just have a moment alone with michael that is not what i said and also i am co-manager meaning you are not the only manager anymore i am also i co-manager that's exactly what wallace told us
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 14",Michael,it is one thing me giving you the co-manager title it is another thing you bossing me around no no no no we will not call david wallace i will call david wallace or david wallace will call us on line two why don't we just-- hey david this is michael senior co-manager got it dave sounds like your classice big-picture decision which is it more of i thought maybe we could talk after this is over no it will not be i am on top of it talk to you later-- okay you didn't let me say good-bye alright i am looking forward to this i hate the fact that we have to do this together i think we work better separately when i am irritated and i look at you i don't see you anymore all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 14",Jim,i'm not bossing you around i'm trying to do my job which is sharing your job so maybe we should just call david wallace hey david you got jim here which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees david i know that i'm very new at this but i have a very good perspective on how things work nope not at all alright thanks alot david you don't have to lie right alright let's get started
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 16",Michael,you know there's no easy way to do this i say we add 15% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it no we can do it during the day it doesn't have to be that dramatic jim jim don't take this the wrong way are you gonna take this the wrong way you use your brain too much sometimes the smartest people don't think at all as i was saying it con-- you look like a nerd pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds con-- you unzip your pants and you find that there's a calculator down there
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 16",Jim,do you mean like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll okay you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options it's hard to tell so far i'm sorry are you advocating that i use it less you just came up with that yeah okay so for the 15% increase pro-- everyone gets a little bit con-- no one gets as much as they did last year pro-- no favoritism
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 17",Jim,i've been studying michael for years and i've condensed what i've learned into this chart-- how michael spends his time as you can see we have procrastinating and distracting others and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking i made it bigger so that you could see it
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 18",Kevin,hey pam i heard that you were registered but i didn't hear where like money like you-- you want my money will you take a check cool in the memo line i'm gonna write 'to love's eternal glory' wait til' monday
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 18",Pam,i don't think we registered anywhere we just want cash mm-hmm yeah okay
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 19",Pam,is this what i've become materialistic shallow i feel horrible oh look 'mrs pam halpert' that's the first time i've seen it in writing
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Jim,you know the more i think about it the more i think we should give it to the salesmen i know i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now 'course i know that this might come off as biased so you know what let us i'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking michael look you have a lot of strengths i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well but there is a reason why i'm here no it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses michael i don't think you're good at making tough decisions at thinking out the options and then stating that decision very clearly especially when it's an unpopular decision but maybe i'm here for a reason because i might have some good ideas too i've been sitting out there and i've been learning a lot and maybe i can just bring something different to the table could i have everyone's attention please i have some tough news so i'm just gonna give it to you straight truth is we only have so much money for raises this year so the simple fact is some people will get raises and some people won't now what we've decided is we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff look you guys are smart so i'm just leveling with you i'm just trying to treat you like adults ooh easy that's not it at all really what it is is about the money the sales staff brings into the office okay dwight you know what you'd be getting the raise so-- wow i'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit so thank you meredith
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Michael,that will not go over well oh my god are you gonna make another pro and con list i'm gonna kill myself no i could not do that jim i can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect if i can just think this through if i could just think it exactly right i can make this perfect and then i can go down every avenue and every avenue off of that avenue and then another avenue and then another-- oh i do tell me what they are ha that-- i am not known for that yes you went over my head to wallace okay well why don't you tell me what those are jim why don't you enliven me ah okay here's a tough decision for you you suck you suck is that clear enough for you okay skippy here we go why don't you run yourself out there and tell them you call it this had better be terrible that was good that was good okay all right well we all know it's hard to be a boss right you know what look around you these are your best friends these are the people who will open their hearts to you they all have heart-ons for you and that is a gift so in terms of gifts we should be giving each other gifts angela yes lend oscar a cup of sugar this-- my plan-- a man-- panama alright let me get this clear does everybody want a raise alright everyone wants a raise so what we're going to do is go into here and we will not come out until we do
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Oscar,thank you jim for thinking that we're smart people excellent question genius it's because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with well hold on kelly would it help you to know that jim thinks you're smart exactly we work just as hard as the sales people we deserve raises we would just like to know what's happening are we getting a raise yes or no again that gives us no information
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Angela,but i do not understand if we're such smart adults then why don't we get raises yes they don't get 'em if we don't get 'em what are you talking about michael
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Kevin,jim is only giving raises to the salesmen totally yeah
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Dwight,this is ridiculous how could he do this to us what about all these people huh how is it fair to them her kid needs shoes jim
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 20",Andy,that's not how that goes
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 21",Michael,what about a raise based on merit mm-hmm piece of cake ryan obviously the best are you making a--
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 21",Jim,rank each person individually well obviously too bad he's a temp and doesn't count so let's get started nope i'm numbering the paper
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 22",Oscar,just--
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 22",Kevin,yeah i don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 22",Angela,it's not like we're not gonna see the checks we're in accounting
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 22",Dwight,and jim i think it was creed
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 23",Jim,it's going really well actually each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise we each got 24 beans so the idea is you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that he's not a part of this you know that okay your move here we go okay you're gonna still have to play that bean you know that
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 23",Michael,toby just wanted to draw a picture of him alright who to pick who to pick i will skip a turn i need more time
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 24",Dwight,people are starting to notice how terrible jim is it's great eventually they'll rise up and revolt my only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later if the people here were our founding fathers the revolutionary war would have been delayed ten years because stanley washington was napping and phyllis hancock was still signing the declaration and kevin jefferson was distracted by a butterfly
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Dwight,come on in that's right come in feast your eyes they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces things were not this bad when just michael was manager
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Oscar,what the hell someone please explain it to kevin
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Michael,hey what are you guys doing in here
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Kevin,what does a bean mean michael what does a bean mean what does a bean mean
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Pam,why aren't there any beans on this very old frizzy-haired picture of me jim
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Jim,i was just trying to be unbiased
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Angela,this is how you make this important decision
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 25",Andy,there's no way that stanley gets more beans than me that is ridiculous this is how it works
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 26",Andy,thank you that is exactly-- by the way i would also like a raise
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 26",Dwight,are we idiots what right does jim have to claim authority hmm is he as good a salesman as i is he as matronly as phyllis there are moments where we can affect change for a few seconds every decade we exist and these are those seconds let us storm his castle come on tick-- let's get him tock-- let's get jim tick-- and drag jim out of his office tock-- take his keys away from him tick-- that's a clock the time is getting very close it's now or never what say you no i mean what do you say to my plan okay
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 26",Kevin,what does a bean mean michael
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 26",Michael,how you doing oh what are you usually usually a ten but i'm feeling like a zero i know i know yes we did um nothing i just i used to have to do this part alone and it was the worst i have something i would like to give you you're welcome gin just pretend we're not here
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 26",Jim,uh on a scale of one to ten i'd say i'm about a four six you i mean a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea right we tried to find the fairest way to do it i just-- what michael's my only friend left in the office except pam i think is she still upset thank you what's in here ooh
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 27",Pam,yeah i mean if it's all the same for you $100 now for sure yeah no no i'll um-- the hundred i'll just take the hundred how sure is this
"Season 6, Episode 3, Scene 28",Pam,the guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 1",Pam,i'm sorry you guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately so if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume and if your lunch is especially pungent maybe have it in the break room
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 1",Jim,we would really appreciate it
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 2",Dwight,pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy if she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed it's amazing a three ounce fetus is calling the shots it's so bad ass
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 3",Pam,phyllis if you could switch to a different soap just for a month or two yours is kind of perfumy
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 3",Dwight,oh gee i'm sorry i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant no i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 4",Pam,i don't think i'm asking for too much i guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 5",Andy,watching people get sick always makes me sick and frankly so does talking about it so wow
"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 6",Michael,what do you think i spent all morning on it it's just a really important day for me thanks

"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 8",Pam,ok all of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding well we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned you know angela you don't have to come to the wedding next time we're all in this room jim and i will be married thank you dwight see you later

"Season 6, Episode 4, Scene 31",Michael,that's not appropriate hello hi everybody i promised i wasn't gonna make a toast and i'm not going to just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim then so be it hey what is the deal with the smart car how smart is that those things are tiny can you even drive them in traffic 'i'm so smart e=mc squared i drive a smart car' that's not smart in my book the real smart car is kitt from knight rider that's a car that can talk can smart car talk nope that's not smart and also chitty chitty bang bang and you everybody can laugh it doesn't have to just be the idiots everybody can laugh yeah go ahead ok ok hey what i think jim is trying to say is that they had an accident and you know what these two people they're living together they're having lots of consentual sex-- yes yes they were living together yes and you know what you can't expect them to be careful every time because frankly it's just a different sensation when you c-- well am i wrong they say it's not different but it's a different sensation when you use something to block-- i think everybody knows what i am talking about it's not necessarily different for the woman-- but it's different for the-- ok ok alright my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema i hope you heard every word jim

"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 8",Dwight,did he threaten you i knew it more trunk space or should i say corpse space no not that by itself but look at all the facts he seems like a mobster exactly
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 8",Oscar,hey guys i drive a suv does that mean i'm in the mob for the record not all italian-americans are in the mafia uhh all right who else is here
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 9",Oscar,pam and jim are on their honeymoon so there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others' toby has mentally checked out since june it's a very dangerous time the 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak

"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 11",Andy,it's john gotti you idiot yeah it's pretty close
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 11",Dwight,no i disagree 'r' is among the most menacing of sounds that's why they call it 'murder' and not 'muck-duck' lock your door

"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 25",Michael,hey uh question for you i recently purchased some insurance that i can't afford given my present salary is there anything accounting-wise i can do to sort of make it all go away oh no um what about this cash for clunkers thing all right well it was a thought thanks
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 25",Oscar,accounting-wise no but phone-wise just call up and cancel it just- no no
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 26",Dwight,we have let michael down and it's 85 percent your fault not on the inside he's not look at his life broke living in fear no friends dead end job not the living in fear that's new yes he's got to stand up to this mafia guy me neither not the way things are now but what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy yeah what is wrong with you i am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown and that happened
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 26",Andy,he's alive so you're welcome yeah some of that existed before you're right that is new well i don't see that happening are you saying- that we surgically remove the fear center from michael's brain that seems a little far-fetched
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 27",Dwight,michael incredible news grotti is clean it's true he's clean i have a couple of friends still on the force checked with them ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take turns out he's a totally lovely guy sweetest guy on the force really and he made us all look like chumps
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 27",Michael,no he's not he's just good nothing sticks to him you still don't understand how this works but grotti acts like he's mafia though
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 27",Andy,no michael what we're trying to say is we made a mistake assuming he was mafia i have a buddy who's a fed and we did a background check on the guy his background is perfectly clean class act boy scout he's trying to intimidate you to close sales he's just a pushy salesman
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 28",Michael,if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars bury them in my yard and i wouldn't tell the cops a thing not that i would be lying per se but i would just get really quiet all of a sudden
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 29",Michael,this is scott oh really is that supposed to scare me well you thought wrong because i am not pleased i'm actually kind of po'd i think you know exactly why because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance i think you knew exactly what you were doing and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk you suck and i'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance how about that the only person that actually needs insurance is you if you show your face around here again got it doubt it what a tool what no what do you mean what oh man i should be mad at you guys but i'm not
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 29",Andy,whoa okay next time you look in the mirror you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia you made the mafia apologize to you you made the mafia be polite
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 29",Dwight,okay that's- that's good let's wrap it up we just told you he wasn't mafia so you wouldn't be scared you successfully backed down the mob
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 30",Michael,so i looked him in the eye and i said 'not today grotti not today and not tomorrow and not the next day or the day after that and you can tell all your friends that if i see them then they're already dead' i said something like that erin coffee not from the kitchen stop and shop if it's not stop and shop i send it back large if it's a medium i send it back if it's an extra large i send it back go any questions
"Season 6, Episode 5, Scene 30",Dwight,very close

"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 5",Pam,michael he means the wall street journal online
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 6",Oscar,i found the article 'on a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings one that is relatively not surprising is dunder mifflin's it is rumored that they will recommend ' and the article cuts off not necessarily bankruptcy could mean a lot of things maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt or it could mean the end of dunder mifflin
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 6",Michael,it's $199 to finish the article i wonder what it was going to say no no that doesn't make any sense oh that sounds awful oh god well that's an interesting theory
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 6",Jim,are you serious
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 6",Andy,i got it i got it oh tuna beat me to it
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 6",Dwight,you know what you can all have jobs at schrute farms as human scarecrows it doesn't pay much and you can't unionize

"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 10",Andy,i like erin there i said it i was kinda hoping she would ask me out but things have not panned out on that front so it is time for the nard dog to take matters into his own paws
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 11",Jim,we have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen listen wallace said these were just rumors right so we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine so if we just go on with our work you and me they'll follow along that's it that rhymes so what have we on the docket today alright let's conference room it up here's the deal guys there is no new information as of yet so i suggest we all just keep working
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 11",Michael,ok we need some sort of distraction for everybody anything new on youtube doesn't even need to be good oh god i can't think need more mullins monkey see monkey do monkey pee all over you we have a monthly staff meeting

"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 13",Jim,customers have to use the coupon code from the website and as of now there is no differentiation between the letter o and the zero but we are working on that stay tuned for that ok great
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 13",Dwight,he needs me seat saved infinity
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 13",Michael,what oh my god there has been a murder there's been a murder in savannah
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 14",Michael,games have the power to distract people from stressful situations battleship got me through my parents' divorce operation got me through my vasectomy ie my operation i don't think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 15",Michael,it is so much fun everybody plays a character we go around the room we try to figure out who did it this is my call jim big picture stuff it's about murder tube city you owe me one
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 15",Jim,hey i am wondering if this is a uh terrible idea i thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 16",Jim,co-managing is a give and take you have to pick your battles one of the battles that i picked was to stop michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them he was going to call it tube city so yes i do owe him one
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 17",Michael,there will be food you leave you do not get food sandwich platters baby carrots
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 18",Michael,ok here are your character cards take one pass it down here is your prop box some of your characters will have props now on your character card it tells you who you are and what your alibi is everything else is up to your imagination so if you talk slowly in real life your character could say have been kicked in the head by a horse ok use your imaginations
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 18",Kevin,whoa i'll try it
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 19",Andy,who'd you get oooooo saucy nathaniel nutmeg the local bartender and nellie's brother
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 20",Angela,michael i don't like this game it's scary i don't like my character voodoo mama juju the witch doctor of the savannah swamps i'm not comfortable with this
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 20",Michael,it's not scary well how do you think i feel i mean i have to play caleb crawdad handsome playboy every night a different woman being oogled having to hug and kiss and spoon i make them feel beautiful
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 20",Pam,who are you
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Michael,well well well what is this contraption i do declare who's michael i'm caleb crawdad i do declare that is the way southern people talk delta burke i do declare now shall we get to the mystery
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Oscar,it's my blackberry michael i am trying to get updates on the company
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Jim,and what designing woman are you basing that on
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Pam,i'll go my name is deborah u tante deb for short bill bourbon was my uncle i would have never hurt him any more than i'd hurt a june bug i do not
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Andy,that's clever debutante well you do actually you've got this kinda like florida panhandle thing going whereas what you really want is more of a savannah accent which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth uh not familiar what province is he from
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 21",Kevin,oooo now do the swedish chef he lives on sesame street dumbass
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 22",Dwight,wait a minute wait a minute i'm the butler you were listening in on that you rich people you think you can do whatever you want to the servant class i will poison your food
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 22",Michael,no no no don't turn this into a political thing
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 23",Andy,i reckon i got something to say to miss beatrix bourbon if'n she don't mind
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 23",Michael,oooooo doggie we got a party now
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 24",Michael,i do believe that the game is a big hit people are really diving into their characters
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 25",Kevin,y'all
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 26",Michael,sir there has been a murder and you are a suspect very good very good now no one was there in the wine cellar
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 27",Andy,hey there young lady i would be remiss if i did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend alright a plan it is
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 28",Dwight,voodoo mama juju explain your dalliance with the dark arts i know you did it
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 28",Angela,it's not my fault i was exposed to harry potter
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 29",Dwight,i know she didn't do it it's never the person you most suspect it's also never the person you least suspect since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most therefore i know the killer to be phyllis aka beatrix bourbon the person i most medium suspect
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 30",Kevin,do you want to go out on a date with me we can make out by the horses nice
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 31",Andy,i'm a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin which would be a whole lot less appealing because naughty nellie says yes to everyone and she might be a murderer
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 32",Oscar,i just got an email from corporate specifically for accounting to stop all payments to our vendors well maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity- this plantation we're running low on greenbacks we're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt we can't pay - michael i can't - basically it could mean a lot of things but it is unprecedented so it's cause for concern
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 32",Michael,whoa what's this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth son this here's savannah no no no no no no no i'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue here we go
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 32",Jim,ok i'm going back to work
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 33",Michael,are you going to believe that that is a mis- that's a misdirection we still don't know who the murderer is nellie nutmeg come back in here i can't do this myself voodoo mama juju what am i gonna do
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 34",Jim,ok so corporate is still in their meeting alright guys it's a work day and you guys work here so let's go do some work oh hey michael listen i brought up those sales targets do you want to- no you're not reopening the case the case is closed
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 34",Kevin,that could be a good sign now jim telling us all to work i think that is a very good sign
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 34",Angela,hey everyone kevin's going to give us his take on the situation let's listen up don't just say things
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 34",Michael,i do believe you have me mistaken my name is caleb crawdad y'all skedaddled way too soon we need to reopen this case no it ain't
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 35",Dwight,frankly i'm not surprised a lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 36",Andy,just thinking about weekend at bernie's it's funny the guy's dead the whole time speaking of weekends you excited about our date this weekend yeah ok well finest steakhouse in all savannah did you mean a real date totally not
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 38",Dwight,you're sure it was water it couldn't have been acid stop playing games with me crawdad answer me you are out of order
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 38",Michael,i already declared you it was too dark to tell this is not a game this is my life you are out of order sir you are out of order you are-
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 39",Pam,i think michael may have snapped well which is worse snapped or stuck
"Season 6, Episode 9, Scene 39",Jim,or maybe he's just stuck in character both they're both worse

"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 5",Pam,mmmm that sounds great what are you thinking no no i still have time
"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 6",Pam,i'm having contractions but they're irregular and far apart so i'm not really in labor i'm near labor if we check in after midnight i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors i cannot wait for that joke to be over
"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 6",Jim,yeah we're slow-playing it because of our stupid hmo not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home if it's crying all night one of us is going to have to take care of it and i do not plan on helping unless it's a boy
"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 7",Pam,ooh you know the baby's not going to live here right okay okay we're not going to the hospital we are waiting until midnight everything's fine we have plenty of time

"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 7",Jim,michael michael you shouldn't have done that hmm that logic's air-tight but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here burning man port-o-potty because the insurance company only covers two nights

"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 7",Dwight,ha nerd
"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 9",Dwight,bare my child i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother if you agree say nothing if you disagree say anything very well let's meet at 4:00 pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out

"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 12",Andy,guys word of advice speaking as a former baby don't get too hung up on baby names i was named walter jr after my father until i was about six or so when my parents changed their minds my brother was born and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr name so they gave it to him i was given andrew which they got out of a baby name book
"Season 6, Episode 16, Scene 12",Michael,no no no no no you know what you can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore distractions are good that means conference room five minutes no no five seconds right now right now conference room topic potpourri let's go

"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 22",Jim,oh guys i really refuse to participate 'michael can i have an advance on my paycheck because a mrs fields cookie just opened up at the mall' sorry gabe but that show hasn't been on in many cookies'
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 22",Andy,hey can i have your attention please first of all thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together and a very special shout-out to the chair of the party planning committee miss angela martin you have outdone yourself i am saying the exact opposite angela is fantastic specific shout-out ok as some of you may know i have a very special connection with secretary's day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named erin hannon to a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations but to me she is my girlfriend in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations so i wrote a little ditty that i would like to play for all of you right now it's a little tune called secretary of love a one a two a one two three can we talk about this in private yes
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 22",Michael,you know what i think we can all agree that angela's not so great so no no no stop talking oh god
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 22",Dwight,yeah pretty much
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 24",Kevin,erin you know if i had been engaged to anyone before you i would've told you so if you need anything i'm right over there c' is for suspension
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 24",Pam,'hey erin you look delicious i mean beautiful' what what do you mean suspend me
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 24",Jim,i think you need to go a little easy you can't just suspend someone form work
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 24",Dwight,wait what i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 25",Andy,why would that be something to talk about on secretary's day i was going to tell her just on my own time
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 25",Michael,andy she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with all right and besides who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them that's like that's like mr and mrs smith crap you know what i resent the implication that i would keep that secret everyone here knows that i can't and won't keep a secret
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 26",Andy,who cares i mean it's not like i killed someone big deal right this can blow over in two seconds she never asked me so if you think about it i probably should have told her i guess everybody does stupid things
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 27",Angela,psst hey erin you embarrassed me earlier you think i want people remembering i had sensual relations with andy it's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled i want to throw up just thinking about it you are throwing up for the wrong reasons
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 28",Pam,hey you know i was engaged before jim yeah and he worked here too no no it wasn't andy it wasn't it doesn't matter it's not about who you've been with it's about who you end up with sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants thank you
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 30",Pam,hey toby very interesting thanks toby i don't think an apology is enough i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 30",Jim,and i got to take this bad attitude and i got to go home and i got to adjust it and i hope the suspension does that
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 30",Dwight,prideful idiots watch how it's done gabriel i apologize i kneel before you humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition
"Season 6, Episode 20, Scene 31",Andy,will you stop walking for one second that's it there's no other secrets ok i mean yeah my chest is not naturally hairless and my parents pay my credit card bill a year yeah but that's it now you know everything about me i promise and if i think of anything else i didn't see that movie

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 5",Oscar,el telefono
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 6",Oscar,michael's having a hard time with the gender part of spanish so i told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender and um i should have been more specific

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 7",Michael,oh eso es lo que dice el damn it ah angelo yo soy cancun

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 8",Jim,all right so i'll finish up on bulk pricing and then you go into delivery guarantee yeah or maybe we don't even need that that's a good point
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 8",Pam,you know maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there like um like 'i just delivered a baby they didn't offer me a guarantee'
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 8",Michael,can you smell the power of the halperts power couple i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 8",Dwight,you know what i should be getting this client michael my numbers are better than either of theirs if you want people to put the best face on something why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 9",Pam,this is our first joint sales pitch i think we're gonna work really well together we have good give and take i give he takes yee
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 9",Jim,yeah i think we have complimentary strengths we understand each other i don't even know who you are anymore

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 10",Michael,did somebody order a hooker over here hi how are you
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 11",Michael,there's this woman i met a few weeks ago her name is donna the manager of sid & dexter's and right now we're in the midst of a passionate love affair um no but she is coming by today maybe to buy some printers so
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 12",Michael,right here we have the wonder twins jim and pam halpert they will be assisting you today
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 12",Pam,oh no we're actually married we're not brother and sister

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 12",Angela,i knew it you should see their baby
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 13",Jim,so yes laser printers are more expensive but they cost less to operate so it's a tradeoff hold on one second what none of this is time sensitive
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 13",Michael,hi sorry to interrupt sorry to interrupt do you donna by any chance shop at victoria's secret because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me uh yes uh the sale is on now through may okay i have more of them
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 14",Dwight,what is this it doesn't just sound a'ight it sounds amazing how do i apply uh glasses wearers cholera survivors geniuses non-organic family farmers the list goes on and on you want me to keep going come here come here ten seconds ago this guy was driving a forklift okay now all off a sudden he's cinderella of the office what are you guys thinking
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 15",Dwight,one minority from this branch is going to get into this program who would i refer hmm the competent hardworking one who does things his own way or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 16",Dwight,oh man white people right well you can kinda tell from the voice i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot just because of your race i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program i know 'cause you have no role models how many indian ceo's can you think of you could be the indian bill gates you could be the indian ted turner that's not she's okay yes
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 17",Michael,i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier and i want to show you there we go whoa look at those vivid colors look at my eyes those are shrek-green eyes that is me again i think this displays the crisp dazzling white and that would be a display of the crisp gorgeous black
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 18",Michael,it's subtle that's how it works i show her an image that turns her on and then she looks at me then back at me then back at the image soon she doesn't know what is me what is the image she just knows that she's turned on
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 19",Michael,this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts i've never taken anybody there before ryan and that's it that's me that's who i am oh thanks you're not bad either hmm jim could you come in here for a sec what was that printer we were looking at
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 20",Michael,you didn't see it pam she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move shortbread oh really jim what about pam and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss maybe this could be my pam
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 20",Jim,no well maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work okay well all that is irrelevant
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 20",Pam,i'll have one maybe michael has a point i mean if she was really that upset she wouldn't still be here
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 22",Michael,look i know that i screwed up in there i know that i probably messed up your sale i just want to go in and fix it
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 22",Pam,what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 22",Jim,what
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 23",Jim,what was that pam you know he's not gonna get anywhere and he's gonna blow our sale hey the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 23",Pam,just let him flirt with her people meet each other all sorts of ways who cares it's not that huge a sale don't act like you understood anything that guy said good luck wingman
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 24",Dwight,how as being a minority affected you oh good and you resent this because oh no no that's not dorky look it's easily accessible boom like this 911 hello scranton strangler's in the house inside the house
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 25",Kevin,look at that she's totally flirting with him like that
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 25",Pam,maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 26",Jim,uh for that printer yes unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility yeah what's that i don't i don't think so
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 26",Michael,so maybe we could find a little wiggle room right maybe wee find some wiggle room i think we could
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 27",Oscar,i don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money delivery alone will cost actually ran the numbers on this and in this case it makes more financial sense to gain money
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 27",Michael,okay well sometimes sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money right like for tax purposes why don't you run them again if she is it's working
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 27",Jim,what if she's just flirting with you to get a better price
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 27",Kevin,yeah michael here's a trick ask her if she wants a mint if she says 'no' then she is not interested
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 28",Jim,she does not like him cause i stopped by your desk like 15 times a day well the joke was on you
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 28",Pam,you can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them how do you think we got together i was after your money yes it was
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 29",Dwight,hey what are you guys doing you know we really should keep practicing for this interview ryan what does he know we'
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 30",Dwight,kelly will be even worse than darryl if you'd have told me this morning that today i'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction i 'd have thought you were referring to the bull mose and i are trying to reanimate
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 31",Michael,so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller operating blahdy blahdy blah boilerplate pound of fish just kidding do you like mints i carry mints with me sometimes you ever tried those they're good sure
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 32",Michael,i can't stop myself from kissing her okay guys guys guys just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time okay what do you think andy okay some for some against pam
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 32",Kevin,yeah now you know how i feel sitting next to those m&m's all day well why don't you shut up i think it's over man

"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 32",Oscar,michael he's right you are turning into a stalker
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 32",Pam,hmm um i think it's really really unlikely really unlikely but i can't say that it's impossible
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 33",Pam,i'm not saying she's in love with him but she could have left a while ago most printer sales are done over the phone ms boob shirt
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 34",Michael,i'm going with pam's group here we go okay no guys guys guys guys just thank you for talking wish me luck
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 34",Jim,wait michael michael michael no
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 35",Michael,what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped given up after two rejections would have been a lot shorter probably been a lot funnier but it would have ultimately been a disappointment i still would have seen it but that's not the point
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 36",Dwight,kelly is disqualified you said the program is not open to caucasians well anthropologically she is indian indians migrated from the caucuses region of europe therefore technically she is caucasian you're welcome america well obviously she is brownish but come on i mean darryl is far more ethnic
"Season 6, Episode 21, Scene 38",Dwight,kelly is the only applicant oh dear god okay don't make any decisions just yet okay i'll be right back

"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 19",Michael,and another thing i did this summer i hired my nephew
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 20",Michael,having luke here is a pretty big deal for me because his mother who also happens to be my half-sister kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14 the last time i saw luke was the opening day of 'ace ventura ii' and that was '95 so yes 15 years on the dot anyway i lost him in a forest
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 21",Michael,don't bother luke that means don't haven't you seen ghostbusters pam no it yes okay right all right yep my bad i got it here we go come on okay um that's as clear as i can make it because i don't want it getting back to sabre that we're yelling at assistants i think it would reflect poorly on us nope it won't be gabe but actually there is somebody in the office that is very very close to luke well dwight he wiped his butt is that close enough for you no no toby he's not yes he is he's my nephew luke is my nephew yes exactly that is a very nice way of putting it oscar mixing family and business is a beautiful thing do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson what if no one named hanson showed up that wouldn't even make sense or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer really safe
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 21",Pam,why is there a circle with a line through it
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 21",Dwight,who's gonna tell on us gabe how close yes of course
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 21",Oscar,michael that's nepotism luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 21",Jim,oh man so many points being made
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 23",Michael,god when he needed help on earth who did he hire jesus christ his son thank you no no i'm just saying why does god get to do something that i don't well then why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad you just want me to fire luke that's reverse nepotism he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does because i wanted you to come to me and say 'wow he is so great' and i was gonna say 'well it's in the genes' and i was actually gonna be wearing jeans and i'd point to them right no but you ruined it so thank you very much here he comes guys look i don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office i just want you to treat him like my nephew hey there he is whoo whoo whoo
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 23",Jim,but you're comparing you and luke to god and jesus
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 23",Oscar,this is hypothetical we're talking about luke who happens to be terrible if there's nothing wrong with this michael why have you been keeping it a secret ah my favorite part of an ice cream party the bagel chips
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 23",Kevin,wait soy ice cream did you get real ice cream

"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 26",Angela,i came down here to feed the feral cats like i usually do and i found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 26",Michael,ok you know what just -just back off back off all right those might be his he might own an ebay store ok ok you know what this is disgusting this is like a witch hunt this is like the blair witch hunt project i'm reconsidering sending them back anyway wait a minute don't-all right well ok you've just committed a felony no i know they fit it's not about the fit
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 26",Jim,yep that's exactly what my first thought was and then i remembered having a conversation with him where he was like 'i don't own an ebay store' so
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 26",Oscar,oh sure those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday yep here they are
"Season 7, Episode 1, Scene 26",Andy,you get that kid to open this car or i'm gonna do it myself by calling tripple a this kid's costing us sales michael

"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 10",Andy,michael have you ever been tested for stds
"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 10",Jim,that was like ten years ago
"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 11",Angela,this is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse
"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 11",Andy,you know what guys why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat ok i was an rea in college and i can tell you number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance

"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 13",Dwight,no i'm no doctor but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease inform them of it and take overwhelming revenge on that person again i'm no doctor i'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge
"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 14",Michael,hi donna it's michael i have a disease for which there is no known cure that has been sexually transmitted to me i can't even say it h-i r-p-e-e-s no i am calling to see if you gave me herpes because if you did i would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations so you have it right does your stupid husband have it yes i am telling you you have to get tested for herpes good-bye

"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 15",Oscar,andy the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention and it seems like you've done it on several occasions
"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 16",Michael,no this is holly no this is holly busted so what can i do for you holly oh really was anyone killed any nuns were they in the missionary position

"Season 7, Episode 4, Scene 31",Andy,i don't know i mean people were being really mean to meredith how is that relevant to anything the only reason i said that is because you asked me so politely it was very difficult for me to say no

"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 19",Jim,around here oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts or correct grammar he really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay mexican
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 20",Andy,megan fox come on yes but one good text away from a high five oh its on

"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 24",Andy,damn it michael you are moments away from the smack down of your life if you don't know something steer the conversation back to something you do know michael i have to tell you something it's from rocky ii this guy doesn't just wanna win y'know he want's to bury you he wants to humiliate you i'm like a quarter of the way through no
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 25",Dwight,here it is right here pull over oh my god no way man look at that there's no building this could only mean one thing she was lying oh pam pam what oh i'm sorry we have a colleague with the same name so okay you're not a liar too are you damn it pam get out right now leave it i mean it get the hell out of here go i can't wait to do to pam what i just did to pam
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 26",Dwight,hey pam y'know what i'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office yeah but i'm still an employee here and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery what's the square footage in the new place what's the exact square footage how many offices are there oh i'll just look at the one sheet myself you're a funny guy pam what's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office i'm going to walk down the hall and say 'wow i can't believe this is real but it is' i can't wait
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 26",Pam ,yeah
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 26",Pam,i know because you're the reason we're moving uhh i think it's something like umm umm let me see oh actually i don't know what i did with the one sheet y'know that's the problem you only have one sheet mmhmm
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 27",Pam,i lied about some aspects of the building there's no building it doesn't exist i needed leverage so i pulled those pictures off the internet it's just this office administrator thing i don't wanna fail i don't want to fail again and that's what you said about art school and that's what you said about sales well i'm not an artist and i'm not a salesman so what would you call it
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 27",Jim,it's still on a bike path though right what does that mean what but you didn't fail and you didn't fail those things either hey hey hey hey hey
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 28",Oscar,michael the reason i asked you down here for this chat is that i've been thinking that your fears about china are a bit exaggerated we have missiles too
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 28",Michael,did you know that china has a new missile that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal but what do i know i mean that's just according to the pentagon our pentagon
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 29",Pam,what well thanks
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 30",Michael,china has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars we are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives and they will control us how then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in china has risen by 17% and in the us it has only risen by 8% don't i
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 30",Oscar,actually we're in a mild recession right now i'll give you that but people use china as the boogie man for all their problems in the nineteen eighties it was japan do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011 do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector i'd say that's far more relevant wouldn't you
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 31",Pam,hello hello you're breaking the law read article nineteen there are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting it also means no more cutting the tampons in two and no more tampering with the toilet paper
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 31",Dwight,impossible i love the law i see i've underestimated you and i didn't think that was possible nate reply the paper reply it
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 32",Oscar,don't worry about the coffee its on me michael i am so happy that we were able to have this little chat what what's your point that's not that wasn't what we were discu that wasn't the whole
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 32",Michael,yeah i figured that wait you forgetting something this chat two men one white one latina a boss and a money cruncher i could fire you here we are my point is that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking nobody can stop the usa i am talking about freedom about choice america i don't think you need to worry because if you want to beat china you will if you don't that's fine that my friend is your victory y'know a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to china and that may be the true but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation you get to a friend so here is to conversation raise your cups on high case closed
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 32",Andy,yeah
"Season 7, Episode 10, Scene 33",Dwight,they say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again i spared pam and i may feast off of her profits for years to come i let pam win haha oh i was not motivated by compassion i have no compassion make sure you got that not motivated by compassion

"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 4",Pam,we're all in it from like years and years ago it's like a home movie michael screened a work in progress for us years ago and it didn't go well we thought it was a comedy everything pointed to it being a comedy
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 5",Pam,we'd love to see it okay everyone i know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in but we have to remember that michael is sensitive so let's stay positive and no laughing no comments just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day okay

"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 9",Dwight,i play samuel michael scarn's robot butler i wanted samuel's voice- to be like this but michael thought that samuel should be a very advance android almost indistinguishable from a real person
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 10",Michael,dwight does not play a robot
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 17",Jim,i did not love the dialogue or the character i took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 24",Dwight,he cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned what was the point of spilling the drink on me
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 30",Michael,by far and away the most expensive shot in the movie but it was integral to the story
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 32",Michael,that was not scripted
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 41",Jim,sorry i'm sorry i'm really really sorry i think i was just relieved to see that michael scarn got his confidence back

"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 41",Michael,well that's a pretty good reaction pretty cool right did you like it did you like that okay no it's not good enough it's not good enough

"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 43",Michael,no no holly this isn't ocean's eleven where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out what'd you really think honestly is it is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me see because i need you to keep me grounded it was eleven years okay this has been my dream for eleven years and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream i talk about a lot of things holly i was eventually gonna get around to my dream obviously eleven years i could've been working on the scarn nebulus because if i don't have this what do i have i have nothing i have my book on business somehow i manage i have my hbo comedy special here i go again dot-dot-dot but you know what when i think about it when i really think about it none of those things are as real to me as my movie yeah you're a real pain in the ass and i'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great and i'm sorry i called you a pain in the ass i'm angry and i love you
"Season 7, Episode 16, Scene 44",Michael,i am a huge woody allen fan although i've only seen antz but i'll tell you something what i respect about that man is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press about how antz was just a rip-off of a bug's life he stayed true to his films or at least the film that i saw which again was antz the thing is i thought bug's life was better much better than ants the point is don't listen to your critics listen to your fans

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 7",Pam,we need a new manager
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 8",Jim,your paper experience is very interesting do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here really what is it you could just be saying it to get the job how about this why don't you give us a part of the plan and that way we know you have it okay did you just trademark that
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 9",Jim,we are the search committee hand-picked by our ceo and tasked to find this branch's new manager not everyone we meet will be good but someone's bound to be right and to be honest i think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house so i'm not too worried but i'm really excited to spend a lot of time with toby and gabe did you know that gabe's last name was lewis i had no idea
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 12",Andy,the manager job nah i'm barely interested i just can't not go for it you know it's not the bernard way we give it the old college try and then in defeat we show grace don't even eeehhhh eeehhh no hehe
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 13",Andy,in my family you don't really go out and get things if you want something you write it on a list and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it on wednesdays and fridays so i don't know i guess you could say this job is on my list and we'll see what rosa comes back with
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 16",Pam,should you really be so blatant about that are you really going to apply for work at scranton breadworks
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 16",Dwight,they won't make me manager and i won't settle for anything less i've gone about as far as i can here that's obvious time to take my talents elsewhere bread is the paper of the food industry you write your sandwich on it
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 17",Jim,unfortunately that range is set at corporate heh we think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 18",Angela,okay how odd a very unusual phone call from the senator's office the senator wants me to have lunch with him at the botanical gardens
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 18",Kevin,the botanical gardens scranton's hidden gem don't eat any berries you don't recognize

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 20",Jim,he creeps me out but i think he might be a genius
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 21",Andy,good luck darryl
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 22",Jim,oh well for instance how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight so i think all we need is a resume and we'll be good right yeah it's no big deal just something that looks like that cool
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 25",Dwight,what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview what are you doing stop trying to figure me out you can't no it's not stop trying to figure me out do you even know anything about paper how it's made get out
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 26",Dwight,i'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak passionless leadership do you see my hat no that's because i just threw it in the ring
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 27",Jim,can i ask why you're leaving your current job is this a bad time to be doing this
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 29",Angela,thank you
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 30",Pam,it's gorgeous angela oh-ho-ho he talked about himself in the third person that's not accurate
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 30",Angela,it's a little flashy i mean what am i naomi judd okay he took me to the replica of monet's japanese bridge and then he put this flower behind my ear which normally i would hate 'cause it's so civil rightsy then he got down on one knee and he said will you be a senator's wife yes pam not everyone is as informal as you and jim oh hey pam dude whatever wanna marry me then i saw flashes reporters were there they always find us and everyone was crying even his aide

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 32",Andy,okay guys it's time it's pep talk time tell me what i need to hear augh
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 34",Jim,so andy what improvements would you make as office manager
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 34",Andy,for starters i really think we can streamline communication around here i wasn't acc- accusing right i really wasn't trying to insult any anyone
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 36",Andy,what okay let me think are you counting car windows uh 93 million miles yeah and the diameter of the sun is 870000 miles which makes it 109 times wider than the earth and 333000 times heavier than the earth
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 36",Jim,is it
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 37",Andy,i am unhappy with the confusing and at times confrontational nature of that meeting i wanted it to go better i wanted it to go better
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 40",Pam,how is this on me
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 41",Pam,hang up corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture intel has told us there were at least seven

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 44",Jim,good yeah peepa great no you're not getting an interview dwight the whole point of this search committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again okay that's vivid yikes well you know how i like taking bribes unfortunately jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment so how would that look for me if i recommended you okay thank you
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 45",Oscar,pam i think robert is gay so i have a very strong suspicion what bathhouse what
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 45",Pam,the senator he was married before and he has a kid and don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids did you see him at a bathhouse the windowless building by the baskin robbins forget it i'm never gonna know what goes on there
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 46",Oscar,my friend at the scranton blade is totally plugged into these matters you're thinking of another group much wealthier much older you sound ignorant no why would we be talking about the senator
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 46",Pam,you're in the gay mafia no

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 52",Jim,that's very interesting um i feel like there might be a conflict there and if a conflict did arise how would that be dealt with i think that's probably all we need to hear from that's very
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 53",Oscar,is there a front runner well there must be someone who stands out well are you
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 53",Jim,you know what they all just sort of blend together after a while no not at all in fact i'm not even taking it seriously i think at the end of the day i'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat uh-- okay everybody i was just making a joke i am taking it seriously i promise
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 54",Jim,no was it good
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 54",Dwight,jo may i speak to you for a second ha ha ha ha ha ha ohh i enjoy laughing at my mistakes because i've learned so much from them i'd like to be interviewed for the position okay it's complicated
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 55",Pam,i'm a woman i would want to know she does seem happy okay
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 55",Kevin,okay but if angela can get a gay man to marry her maybe i could get a lesbian to marry me huh huh that's hot we don't tell her

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 60",Jim,oh i didn't know you knew her no you know she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 65",Angela,stanley i won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding because we want to keep it to 350 i mean we just have to see how many senators and members of congress want to attend before we can open it up to regular people pam you know how you and jim did your ironic wedding do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford niagara falls pregnant that was your dream pork medallions hmm

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 67",Dwight,well it's not entirely up to you is it seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad what a surprise minorities sticking together
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 67",Andy,tuna you're completely sane who do you like for the job is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first but now seems like a safe if not slightly unexciting choice whoever it is i think they should be lame kind a a non-threatening moderate personality
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 67",Kevin,do you mean it anybody are you sure okay well what do 'i' want in a manager let me see what do 'i' want so now anyone gets to talk at any times what do 'i' want i'm looking for someone who everyone is listening to me

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 67",Pam,a homeless person really a homeless person no i want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 69",Jim,hey hey hey

"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 71",Angela,well let me be clear i only speak for myself and not myself and the senator i think we have some wonderful candidates and there's a great lively debate here but let's think about-
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 71",Kevin,exactly
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 72",Andy,sometimes you hear about people failing upwards i think i'm about to do that
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 79",Dwight,i will run this branch or i will destroy this branch or i don't know something always works out
"Season 7, Episode 24, Scene 80",Pam,is that right well okay
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 1",Oscar,oh for god's sake
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 2",Oscar,planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend basically you lie like a plank in weird places that's it sometimes you get run over welcome to the internet
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 4",Andy,after you my good sir i insist
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 4",Dwight,no i insist
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 5",Jim,the search committee finally decided after a lot of deliberation on robert california- for the manager position who took one look around and left he drove down to florida and convinced joe to make him ceo ceo her own job he talked her out of her own job and i don't really know how someone does that but anyway then the position was his to fill and he chose-
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 6",Andy,i- it's unbelievable true i may have been the second choice but i was the first-choice's first choice and about dwight i sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so i sat him down and we had a talk and i told him i need a really strong number two i want you to be my enforcer smart right uh this has got to stop
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 7",Dwight,k kevin
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 8",Dwight,yeah at first i was really disappointed but i've got a great daily routine going right now i have upped my karate to eight times a week i've added boxing - lunches and on weekends i do kickboxing three times a week krav maga four times a week an hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset so yeah i'm doin' great

"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 16",Dwight,say no more
"Season 8, Episode 1, Scene 17",Dwight,kids don't try planking it's dangerous 'specially with me around

"Season 8, Episode 3, Scene 20",Dwight,well they whipped people which was helpful but you're right we should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than madge or heday no no very smart uh theirs is more of a physical intelligence like baboons or elephants kevin doesn't apply
"Season 8, Episode 3, Scene 21",Andy,does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap you'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously um
"Season 8, Episode 3, Scene 22",Andy,no because they all left i mean after you bailed i got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help what are you talking about i'm not gonna fire you ok this is weird i don't i don't get the joke
"Season 8, Episode 3, Scene 23",Andy,so darryl says to me 'fire me' but what he really means is 'i'm gonna say something really weird try and figure out what it means' so i say 'no you're not fired' but what i really mean is 'i have no idea what your talking about but i'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better'i really hope that's what he and i mean

"Season 8, Episode 5, Scene 40",Pam,jim doesn't let me wash his nfl jersey during the playoffs how is this any less logical really

"Season 8, Episode 5, Scene 47",Jim,like a few years down the road cece says 'mom there's a ghost in my closet' now you say one of two things - one 'you're just having a bad dream' or two 'let's go see what it was' ok oh come on

"Season 8, Episode 5, Scene 52",Oscar,interesting every culture holds this true clearly there's some sort of real phenomenon out there
"Season 8, Episode 5, Scene 52",Jim,oscar how are you on that side but that would make more sense
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 1",Andy,hey everybody it's closing time you don't got to go home but you can't stay here closing time
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 2",Andy,every office needs an end of the day tradition something to tell you the day is over otherwise you go home and the night just feels like more day it's weird

"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 8",Dwight,sorry go ahead wha- yes your attention uh because- no that is all
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 9",Dwight,last night i dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world the vice president had all the power athletes fought for silver medals women were considered the best gender and stadiums of fans shouted 'we're number two' as with all my dreams i'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 10",Andy,umpf'that's not good chalk that one up to tweedle dee and tweedle dumb out there they're both kevin oscar is the sex and the city gang and angela if you can picture- i would agree with that end the mistakes easy- i would like that

"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 13",Dwight,i may have a little solution to our mistakes problem this is a project i've been working on for quite some time and today might be the day to use it allow me you're going to love this ugh'should've used a shorter string never mind i know it by heart it is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work have i not been worthy of your trust have i not been a reliable number two well i can make this work i'll set it up right now just need your go ahead i will do my voodoo
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 13",Andy,what do you got sounds controversial do not go there you're the deuce i never want to drop go do the voodoo that you do so well mmhmmm
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 15",Andy,hi guys i just wanted to say that you all have been doing amazing work really and i'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy so dwight and i have implemented a new program that we like to call 'dwight' if we as a group make five mistakes in a day something bad happens like we block minesweeper
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 15",Kevin,thank you
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 15",Dwight,the accountability booster it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office from a late delivery to an accounting error five strikes in a day equals a home run one home run and you're out or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown and as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him robert's favorite songs: creep by tlc creep by radio head you remember that one jim there is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper oscar he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him kelly ps we should should kill him no it's an accountability booster jim you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other i am confident that you guys are equal to the task smile- nod smile and nod
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 15",Jim,wait so you installed a doomsday device which when it goes off it destroys everything very similar to a doomsday device
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 16",Dwight,they are making me out to be a bond villian i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world like- not doctor moreau someone good doctor frankenstein doctor jekyll not them doctor-
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 17",Andy,are you sure this is a good idea i mean the thing about this office is we make a lot of mistakes
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 17",Dwight,but the device will change that without a safety net people will improve
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 18",Andy,alright everybody looks like we need to be getting to work be extra careful double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so i-
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 18",Oscar,there's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham we just make a mistake i'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 18",Dwight,oh there's one mistake it's not a doomsday device gosh we can do this you guys
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 22",Kevin,i'm on it good thinking
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 22",Angela,kevin maybe i should handle that we really need you to focus on your project
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 23",Kevin,apparently a big client for this company needs to know the story of how paper gets made
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 24",Angela,oscar use a calculator

"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 26",Dwight,well i wouldn't say that three mistakes already is pretty terrible but i do see improvement meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work no questions accountability booster i haven't even considered it that's how sure i am that this accountability booster is going to work
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 26",Jim,dwight question if this doomsday device goes off if this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs are you going to feel good about that
"Season 8, Episode 6, Scene 27",Jim,ok nope hmm- heda no

"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 7",Pam,it's going to be good to have someone hot at pam's desk huh i'm kidding oh my gosh you guys she's obviously super cute i get it but i'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing thank you really you guys thank you very sweet really well thank you all
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 7",Dwight,ok ok ok no no no this is disgusting you realize what you're saying the hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman no there are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman yes you are and another thing helen mirren was born helen mironov that's right you're fake salivating over a soviet era russian
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 8",Andy,ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray thank you i think i said doop instead of boop at one point hey robert are we meeting early well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes thank you miss no more what do you play join us ceos don't play tambourines tambourines are for girlfriends great

"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 10",Pam,hey helen mirren hot huh what about cathy yeah do you think she's hot i'm not asking if you're in to her just objectively do you find her attractive you don't find cathy attractive
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 10",Jim,hey yeah super pretty the temp nope and i'm telling you i don't no i don't
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 11",Jim,no i'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that i find her replacement objectively attractive just like i'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun it's true but it doesn't help anybody
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 12",Pam,look at her even i want some fries with that shake yes because she's hot right
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 12",Jim,okay uh i don't so are we good
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 12",Dwight,that's just absurd her breasts are large her waist is small her reproductive health in ample evidence and facial symmetry- come on
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 13",Pam,the thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently like you're a kid almost they lose all sense of boundaries they start acting weird telling you things that clearly aren't true i know it sounds nuts but i think dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 14",Pam,dwight am i hot right now what about before was i attractive before hmm i think jim's lying to me about not being attracted to cathy five bucks if you can get him to admit it yep that's the dwight i need okay i think so okay well what does that is that okay yep good
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 14",Dwight,why would i or anyone else think that you're hot right now i can't impregnate you and that's the driving force between male-female attraction meh you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time gradual recovery and uh well now obviously you're at an all-time low you think jim's lying that's so cute i know he's lying done i never touch a pregnant woman if we're going to work together we need some ground rules rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth rule two: we stop at nothing rule three: don't fall in love
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 15",Dwight,we're gonna bust this guy so important and then we will destroy the man himself
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 15",Pam,honesty is very important to me let's just see how we feel when we get there
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 16",Dwight,none taken what do you got

"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 19",Pam,kelly calm down i don't think jim cares about his hair jim's on to me yeah jim barely talks to mike we had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it yep
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 19",Dwight,i don't see what's so ugly about him he's got the broad face of a brewer hmm just ugly enough to have deniability
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 20",Jim,mike tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy i know so if that was for the matchmaker test i think i'm in the clear if that wasn't for the matchmaker test then cathy he's a really nice guy
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 21",Dwight,well jim may be lying with his words but he can't lie with his body the male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs the puffing of the chest mirroring increased blood flow to the crotch i say we start there with the crotch
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 21",Pam,no kelly don't
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 22",Kevin,whoo
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 23",Dwight,psst we're not here exactly okay just shut it i can't tell it's unnaturally sunken busted he just was mirroring did you see that jim has no discernible sense of humor pam you should know that time for me to find out just going to walk over here- whoa whoa i'm slipping and falling oh stumbling i need something to grab on to i'm fine i'm totally fine yes wha- jim aw cramp i'm just- i'm sorry i fell down mr balance does your husband have very soft erections because if not i just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing

"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 25",Pam,oh hey i'll just be a second okay oscar cathy has a question yeah why won't you just admit that she's attractive it's kind of annoying that you won't say it well dwight had this idea and i thought it was kind of crazy but maybe that's where we are now
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 25",Jim,mm-hmm told you you okay okay what can i do to make you believe me
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 26",Dwight,she called it crazy aw man that's insulting all i did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test monitoring his blood pressure pulse perspiration and breathing rate
"Season 8, Episode 7, Scene 27",Pam,yeah its nuts but i don't know what else to do

"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 17",Andy,after chancellorsville lee brought his army up the shenandoah valley right through here they stopped in this field for a picnic which they called lunch
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 17",Dwight,total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you're talking about dpa that's deaths per acre nothing beats the battle of schrute farms oh it is and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home i mean it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush i'm telling you they're heartbreaking too so beautifully written the truth no no no you're filling her head with nonsense you and the history books i'm telling the truth yes thank you all of history has been whitewashed okay i will i don't know who that is but i'm gonna tell you this- gettysburg was very important credit where credit is due okay big mad props to gettysburg was it however the most northern battle of the civil war not by a long shot no it was not no it was not was it the second-most northern sure i will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle was it the northernmost no get out of here oscar

"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 20",Oscar,i apologize for my friend and for the republicans who are cutting your funding
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 20",Andy,we don't need to bother this poor gentleman i know exactly where we're going giddy up tallyho
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 22",Pam,okay you know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools i was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us and as you know as i tell it i don't like it unless of course you are responding to it um excuse me i'm gonna go to the bathroom
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 23",Pam,at this point when you're this pregnant it's kind of like senior spring the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 24",Kevin,well you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the a-1 spot they do that 'cause they think a-1's the best spot for the best cookie but the real best spot is d-4 right that's where the eyes go so yeah but not just the cookies though that was just a 'for instance'
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 27",Kevin,kay so another thing about oatmeal cookies who even wants them i mean i've seen toby eat one like once but other than that like forget it thank you
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 28",Jim,by the way did we leave all the food on the bus yeah that's what i had for breakfast and i think that's probably why i'm still hungry only two hundred dollars
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 28",Andy,let's talk about food for a second food for thought hunger hunger for victory hunger for honor hunger for pride exactly now do you know the civil war soldiers were hungry for pride now each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives colonel harrison jeffords of the fourth michigan infantry saw his flag being carried away chased it down with nothing but a sword fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died he wasn't about to let them have that flag pride right guys i commissioned this flag for dunder mifflin cost me two hundred dollars we are all branches on this tree and from the tree comes paper we're all part of a business but business is war what's that i hear uh a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag wha- what's going on here wee-hoo come and get it who's gonna get the flag who's getting it whoa hey ho don't look where i am look where i'm going juke right juke left get the flag get the flag come on big tuna what you gonna do about it we got a flag right here wee-hoo
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 29",Andy,spangler springs is a mile this way its- i mean come on alright fine you know what i guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way i hoped it would i'm still going and i'm not going to ask anymore i'm not even going to look back i'm just going to assume that you're with me
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 29",Jim,oh wow so that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 29",Dwight,you said you weren't going to look back
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 30",Kevin,i don't know yes i am an accountant
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 31",Oscar,dwight this is one of the archivists here i thought maybe we could consult him yeah you've heard about it
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 31",Dwight,really well anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms yes ha prepare to be refuted go on
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 32",Dwight,hallowed ground i've seen enough
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 32",Oscar,wow this is so much better than the story you made up you're right there should be a monument to this
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 33",Kevin,never trust a cookie with a woman's name pecan sandy lorna doone madeline they'll just break your heart what no no this is not fair this is my idea he's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me every time you buy a big mac you set one ingredient aside then at the end of the week you have a free big mac and you love it even more because you made it with your own hands
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 34",Andy,dammit you guys came where's everyone else yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there i guess he follows orders even without an audience you're still at it our office has a disease and it goes by many names sarcasm snark wisecracks you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes that's what you did with this trip you don't like the hats they just didn't turn out how i wanted in my head they were cooler but they do look weird
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 34",Jim,yeah sorry everyone else didn't come i think they're just tired with holes in their shoes and they have dysentery what are you talking about andy this whole idea of our situation being just like war it's just not true we just work at a paper company and you're our regional manager and guess what man you don't have to prove anything we like you as regional manager andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head i'm wearing a very pink hat i've been getting weird looks all day because i'm pretty sure 'dm does gb' means something kinda sexual but guess who's wearing them all of us just for you man that's huge they're terrible
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 35",Andy,the world will little note nor long remember the fight jim and i had here at gettysburg and that's good because i was basically wrong i wanted my team to be like this army and i was their general but i guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and i'm their manager yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that i think about it
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 37",Kevin,i can do that your arm feels good on my back
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 38",Kevin,for some reason my boss is obsessed with cookies it's not my specialty my specialty is pizza but i'm flexible
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 39",Andy,charge it's kind of a haul so we should probably get going and tuna i made a special sandwich for you guess which kind yes tuna of the land turkey with pesto water

"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 43",Dwight,best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves then you dance and work the urine into the root systems doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face either
"Season 8, Episode 8, Scene 44",Oscar,guys over here we found the bus and that's how the printing press was invented

"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 8",Jim,things are a little delicate with me and pam right now and if my working in philly is gonna end up doubling the dwight in her life that's only gonna make things worse
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 9",Dwight,hey come on buddy let's do this sorry rolf goes first you don't compare when you're with the r-o-l-f you're literally rolling on the laughing floor

"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 13",Jim,i'm on the phone i'm on the phone i'm just gonna call you back thanks i'm sure he's just nervous
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 13",Pam,it's fine it's just a seating arrangement doesn't matter
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 14",Dwight,so i've got your resume here but it's not telling me everything well i'm the one offering the job i've worked here for 12 years i won salesman of the year i'm an assistant to the regional manager wait wait wait no i mean if you need to know more you can call david wallace i'm sure he'd give a reference
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 15",Dwight,well they can't all be winners but trevor's next and he's a real professional you say 'jump' and he says 'oh who' he loves to jump on people that trevor
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 16",Dwight,what makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman well it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman all right do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter there were only two options this is a bus transfer
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 17",Jim,sure yeah go ahead yeah absolutely do people like sitting next to you you're clean right nice music do you listen to it in earbuds you don't listen to it at all because we're at work not a florence and the machine concert so- sure yeah do whatever you need to do right after you do one thing for me i need you to breathe in my face i need you to breathe in my face right now what are we working with peppermint or wintergreen i knew it i knew it i looked at you coming around and i said 'wintergreen'
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 18",Dwight,i can't hire clark yeah he looks like a schrute but he thinks like a halpert and he acts like a beesly
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 19",Dwight,okay here's one a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock you can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party thank you damn it perfect answer again think dwight think you have a ream of 16-bond - and anoth- no it does but still no oh you think they're my only friends i've got way more friends than that and they're all better than the losers who work here
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 21",Oscar,just - i don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 21",Pam,well of course not but does physical appearance include smell
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 21",Kevin,meredith i tell you all the time
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 22",Dwight,next up my cousin mose mose could make a great paper salesman he's got a natural fear of paper which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible i've got big expectations mose-wise
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 23",Dwight,what quality would make you a good sales associate it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical you know we live together right and i've never seen you go to work ever so why is this on your resume
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 25",Dwight,when i was young i spent several years at a private school where i was told i would be taught to harness my mutant abilities turned out it was a conman copying charles xavier's school for gifted youngsters from the x-men comic books took me years to figure out that it was a con some people never figured it out
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 27",Angela,i don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years someone say something
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 27",Jim,how is it my fault but it's dwight who's bring in all the weirdos
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 27",Oscar,yeah but jim dwight's a weirdo we can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos we can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 27",Pam,hey i'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when jim's away i'm in a position where i'm rooting for nate and that just feels wrong forget it i need to work on my mural i have some pointy trees that i need to round off
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 28",Jim,yeah this is actually about the new sales guy uh dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos and i was wondering if i could have some input- i was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk near my wife- oh um- okay i can't say that that's not fair oh yeah so we'll just do that later uh well it's about athlead i'm sorry does dwight have to be on this part of the phone call there's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor - yes okay bye no thanks
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 28",Dwight,this is dwight schrute who am i speaking to and don't lie i can tell if you're lying david really that's interesting 'cause i was thinking that since jim is only here part time he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day and frankly killing it lately sounds fair to me david no why not do it now i'd love to be in the loop david i'd love to invest i'd like to give you $100 million
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 29",Pam,hide they're giving out jobs upstairs why don't you go up and get one yeah
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 32",Jim,dwight you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 32",Dwight,i'm not these people are the best of the best i find talent an attractive quality in a friend you know who else was a freak spider-man and he was also a hero
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 33",Dwight,mandatory paintball uh wolf please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 34",Dwight,wolf is hilarious he has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range half of 'em we were on the same team oh my god how i screamed ah that goof
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 35",Dwight,sell me this piece of paper watch this i sure do i will pay you whatever it takes no you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it so here just take my money okay good that was great so wow you're still at the 570 number okay good good good
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 36",Dwight,this isn't gonna work out
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 37",Dwight,nate is a proven entity but not without his handicaps; hearing vision basic cognition trevor is great but i saw no fire in him today and this is a guy who loves to start fires troy is literally one of a kind he's a goblin or a hobbit or a kobold which is a type of gremlin and yet i'm hesitant why can't i pull the trigger on any of them
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 38",Dwight,no no no i just need to tell them i just need to tell them i do that myself now
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 39",Dwight,no you've been towed by now they tow after about 45 minutes or none of you i wish i could hire all of you

"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 41",Dwight,and i was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife aah god that sucks aah what are you gonna do i mean it's your call i guess i just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends i just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 41",Jim,but you know i wouldn't hire any of these all-stars nope your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought not even gabor i knew it you designed a uniform for dunder mifflin
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 42",Dwight,summer winter jungle formal
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 43",Jim,well i for one was amazed at how qualified everyone was you and i gotta say this was a tough decision and we had to go with none of you well you know wallace put me in charge so you have no say too much now that seems inconsiderate all right i think that went well
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 43",Dwight,yes thank you amazed what this is such bullcrap wow so much crap it's just a load of bc how could you do this to them okay okay this is an outrage ugh you know what this is jim halpert's home address in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever guys it wasn't up to me rolf come on guys it wasn't my choice i would have hired all of you gabor gabor oh that sounds awesome can we wait till i get off work okay
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 44",Jim,so uh if you just take a look at this and then that'll print out 'hey meet your new desk mate' trust me this is the least of all evils it took me all day to pull this off so you should be thrilled considering okay i'm really sorry i told the guys i'd be there for the board meeting i'll call you when i get there all right take care of my wife i will be back
"Season 9, Episode 13, Scene 44",Pam,oh cool hey clark yeah i guess i mean i kinda liked my old desk mate of course okay bye

"Season 9, Episode 23, Scene 60",Pam,listen um i was scared you know i loved what i had and i didn't want to risk it and i think that maybe i did doubt him a little too which was wrong because he's shown me time and again but when the documentary started airing people on the street told me that i had this fairy-tale romance but there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale but then it got deeper and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale it's like a long book that you never want to end and you're fine with that because you just never ever wanna leave it yeah like harry potter

"Season 9, Episode 23, Scene 96",Kevin,if there is one thing that i have learned through this whole experience it's that if you film anybody long enough they're going to do something stupid it's only human natural

"Season 9, Episode 23, Scene 103",Oscar,you take something ordinary like a piece of paper it's not much but if you see it in the right way-and that's what you did with this documentary but seriously you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami
"Season 9, Episode 23, Scene 106",Jim,imagine going back and watching a tape of your life you could see yourself change and make mistakes and grow up you could watch yourself fall in love watch yourself become a husband become a father you guys gave that to me and that's an amazing gift
